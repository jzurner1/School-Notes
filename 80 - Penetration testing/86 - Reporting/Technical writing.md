## Summary
Technical writing is a form of writing with the goal of communicating information to others in order to teach them how to do something or spread technical information.

## Details
"Technical writing is about communicating key information to the people who need it in the most suitable way and format. That might be a printed material, but it could also be a graphic or a video.

That information might be a tutorial for a software application, a guide to using heavy machinery safely, a diagnostic aide for medical practitioners, or a guidance note about new legislation"

"According to the Society for Technical Communications, technical communications has one or more of the following characteristics:
1. Communicating about technical or specialised topics, such as computer applications, medical procedures or environmental regulations.
2. Communicating through printed documents or technology, such as web pages, help files or social media sites.
3. Providing instructions about how to do something, regardless of the task’s technical nature."

"Technical communication tends to answer the six important questions. These are: what, when, why, where, who and how – and often with an emphasis on the ‘how’. It may be provided as text, images, video, simulations, online help or in a number of other formats. The information in technical communication is targeted to the needs of the people using it to complete a task."

There are ten "golden rules" to technical writing:
1. Paper is permanent - Be sure to write correctly and professionally as well as proof reading and editing
2. Know your audience - Know who will be reading the paper so you can take into consideration the technical and product knowledge of the users
3. Highlight hazards - Make apparent things that are particularly important such as dangers, warnings, and notes
4. Break it out - Separate content into shorter sentences and graphical illustrations to make it easier to find information
5. Don't write blind - Learn about the topic well enough that you are confident you can write about it; don't use second hand information
6. Be consistent - Refer to things in the same way throughout the document and use the same styles, fonts, and layouts, or a style sheet
7. Signpost - Use signposts to direct users to correct information at the appropriate place in the document as needed
8. Don't violate standards - Don't use non-standard terminology but avoid customs that are incorrect; be knowledgeable about issues such as compliance and regulations
9. Contemplate before you illustrate - Only add illustrations that you need, and only parts that you need. Do not overcomplicate them and keep them relevant for the subject matter
10. Cut the fluff - Use proper language and keep it short; don't use any passive voice or strong verbs

There are another 9 tips:
1. Create a persona - imagine who exactly will be reading your document and write as if it were just for them
2. Beware of scope creep - When planning a document, be sure to plan the scope so you don't go outside of it
3. Writing should be easy - You must make the planning process a big part of writing to make writing easier
4. Be timeless - Make sure the document can be read in the future; tt must have explanations for relevant legislation
5. Use attributions - Let readers who need more information find it easily
6. Use global English - Avoid idioms and some words that can be both a noun and a verb, and follow general guidelines
7. Forget the word count - Length of the document doesn't matter
8. Be humble - Accept feedback from others and learn from mistakes
9. Use graphics to illustrate - Let graphics give information that words can't
