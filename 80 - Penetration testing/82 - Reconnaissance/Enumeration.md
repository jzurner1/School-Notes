Enumeration is the third phase in hacking, coming after [[Reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] and [[Scanning|scanning]]. It is the process of extracting information (usernames, machine names, network resources, shares, services) from a system or network. In this phase, an attacker creates active connections with the system and sends directed queries to gain more information about the target. This information can be used to identify vulnerabilities.

Enumeration can allow the attacker to collect:
- Network resources
- Network shares
- Routing tables
- Audit and service settings
- [[SNMP|SNMP]] and [[FQDN|FQDN]] details
- Machine names
- Users and groups
- Applications and banners
