Footprinting is the first step in ethical hacking. It refers to the process of collecting information about a target network and its environment, similar to [[Reconnaissance|recon]] but in a more professional way.

Footprinting helps to:
- **Know security posture**, which is the organization's current security position
- **Reduce focus area** to minimize the amount of time used in an attack
- **Identify vulnerabilities** to make it much easier to successfully attack
- **Draw a network marp** to know the actual environment that will be attacked

Footprinting enables threats such as:
- **Social engineering** to directly or indirectly collect information through persuasion and other means with minimal intrusion
- **System and network attacks** to potentially take control of a target system or the entire network
- **Information leakage** that can be found on outside sources
- **Privacy loss** for the organization or personnel

# Passive footprinting
Passive footprinting is the same concept as passive recon. It involves gathering information about the target without direct interactions, used when information gathering should not be detected by the target.

Techniques include:
- Finding information through search engines (such as [[Google dorking|Google dorking]])
- Find the top-level domains (TLDs) and subdomains of a target through web services
- Collecting location information through web services
- Performing people searches using social networking sites
- Gathering financial information about the taget through financial services
- Gathering infrastructure information and positions through job sites
- Deep or dark web footprinting, if applicable
- Performing competitive intelligence
- Monitoring the target with alert services
- Gathering information through groups, forums, blogs, and NNTP Usenet newsgroups
- Social engineering on social networking sites
- Gathering information through internet archives
- Gathering information using business profile sites
- Monitoring web traffic of the target

# Active footprinting
Again, active footprinting is the same concept as active recon. It involves any information gathering processes that may be detected by the target. This includes direct interactions with the target network and therefore requires more preparation.

Techniques include:
- Querying published name servers of the target
- Searching for digital files
- Extracting website links and gathering wordlists from the target website
- Extracting metadata from published documents and files
- Gathering website information through web spidering and mirroring tools
- Gathering information through email tracking
- Harvesting email lists
- Performing Whois lookup
- Extracting DNS information
- Performing traceroute analysis
- Performing social engineering
