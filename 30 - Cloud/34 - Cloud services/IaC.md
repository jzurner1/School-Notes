Infrastructure as code, also known as programmable infrastructure, is when infrastructure is virtualized in the cloud. It is easy to create and destroy parts of the infrastructure as well as maintaining it using scripts. It is possible to spin up test environments with ease.

A number of tools such as CloudFormation by AWS permit you to easily generate code required to script the creation of useful and complex infrastructures.

If, for example, you need to set up 50 servers for a test project, you can do this very quickly instead of using expensive physical servers.
