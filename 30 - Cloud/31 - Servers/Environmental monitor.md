The components that make up a computer network (routers, switches, etc) are designed to operate within certain environmental limits such as temperature, humidity, and so on. This is considered part of the network's performance metrics.

Similar to other devices, environmental monitors log data and can send out a notification if any issues are detected. Some monitors will send notifications to SNMP servers known as SNMP traps.
