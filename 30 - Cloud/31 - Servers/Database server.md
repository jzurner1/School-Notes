### PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is known for its advanced database features and supports fancy features that would be found in a commercial relational database server such as transations, updatable views, triggers, foreign keys, functions, and stored procedures.

While it is very versatile, it is very complex. It used to be very slow but has since made advancements.

### MySQL
MySQL focuses on speed and for that reason it has become the de facto database server for many high-profile internet web applications. The combination of a Linux server running Apache, MySQL, and using PHP has become known as the LAMP platform and is very popular.

Since its creation, MySQL has added features that can rival those found in PostgreSQL and commercial databases. However, it still remains the speed it is known for.

### MongoDB
MongoDB utilizes a popular object-oriented method of storing data called NoSQL. This stores data as individual documents instead of in tables, where each document can contain different data elements, with each element being independent from the other data elements in the database.

MongoDB stores data records as individual JSON elements. It supports many relational database features such as indexes, queries, replication, and load balancing. It also allows you to incorporate JavaScript into queries, making it very versatile.
