Hyper-V is a virtualization software created by Microsoft.

# Types of switches
Hyper-V uses virtual switches to communicate with other devices. There are three types.

- **External** switches are bound to the physical NIC located on the host computer. They provide the virtual machine with access to the physical network that the host is using.
- **Internal** switches are not bound to the physical NIC and only allow traffic between the host and the virtual machine.
- **Private** switches allow communication between virtual machines and let them communicate with each other.
