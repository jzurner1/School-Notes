A virtual machine is a separate operating system from the host computer run on a hypervisor.


# Network connections
There are three types of network connections that can be made with a virtual machine.

### Private network
Only devices directly connected to the network can communicate on it. This usually means only VMs and no internet.

### Internal network
An internal network sets up communication between the host system and the virtual machines on it.

### External network
An external network connects virtual machines and the host's physical network, allowing virtual machines to communicate on the same network as the host, operating as any other node on the network.
