Perfect forward secrecy (PFS) is an encryption system that regularly changes keys to encrypt and decrypt information. This means that different pieces of data are encrypted with different keys, preventing the leak of a key from exposing all of the data in a system.

PFS is very common. For example, messaging platforms may use a different key after every message.
