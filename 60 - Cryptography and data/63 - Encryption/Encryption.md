The capability of a device to scramble data from a sender in a way that can be unscrambled by the receiver but not any other party that may intercept the data. Used in VPNs.

To unscramble, or decrypt, the data, a key is used. When the sender and the receiver share the same key, it is called symmetric encryption. When two keys are used, it is called asymmetric encryption.
