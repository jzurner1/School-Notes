Asymmetric encryption is a key system where two keys are used. One of the keys is kept secret and is referred to as the private key, while the other is widely available and is referred to as the public key.

The public and private keys are mathematically related so that the information encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key. This is slower but more secure and scalable than [[Symmetric encryption|symmetric encryption]].

### RSA
The most popular method of asymmetric encryption is RSA, named after its creators. RSA is commonly used as part of a public key infrastructure (PKI) system, specifically used for digital certificates and certificate authority (CA) for authentication and encryption services.
