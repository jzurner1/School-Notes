The vulnerability management life cycle is a process that helps identify and remediate security weaknesses before they can be exploited. This includes defining the risk posture and policies for an organization, creating a complete asset list of systems, scanning and assessing the environment for vulnerabilities and exposures, and taking action to mitigate the vulnerabilities that are identified.

The phases in vulnerability management are:
- Identify assets and create a baseline
	1. Identify and understand business processes
	2. Identify the applications, data, and services that support the business processes
	3. Identify the approved software, drivers, and basic configuration of each system
	4. Create an inventory of all assets and prioritize/rank the critical assets
	5. Understand the network architecture and map the network infrastructure
	6. Identify the control already in place
	7. Understand policy implementation and practice standard compliance
	8. Define the scope of the assessment
	9. Create information protection procedures to support effective planning, scheduling, coordination, and logistics
- [[Vulnerability scanner|Vulnerability scan]]
	1. Examine and evaluate the physical security
	2. Check for misconfigurations and human errors
	3. Run vulnerability scans using tools
	4. Select the type of scan based on the organization or compliance requirements
	5. Identify and prioritize vulnerabilities
	6. Identify false positives and false negatives
	7. Apply the business and technology context to scanner results
	8. Perform OSINT information gathering to validate the vulnerabilities
	9. Create a vulnerability scan report
- Risk assessment
	1. Perform risk categorization based on risk ranking
	2. Assess the level of impact
	3. Determine the threat and risk levels
- Remediation
	1. Prioritize remediation based on the risk ranking
	2. Develop an action plan to implement the recommendation or remediation
	3. Perform a root-cause analysis
	4. Apply patches and fixes
	5. Capture lessons learned
	6. Conduct awareness training
	7. Perform exception handling and risk acceptance for the vulnerabilities that cannot be remediated
- Verification
	1. Rescanning the systems to identify if an applied fix is effective in remediating the vulnerability
	2. Performing dynamic analysis
	3. Reviewing the attack surface
- Monitoring
	1. Periodic vulnerability scan and assessment
	2. Timely remediation of identified vulnerabilities
	3. Monitoring intrusion detection and intrusion prevention logs
	4. Implementing policies, procedures, and controls
