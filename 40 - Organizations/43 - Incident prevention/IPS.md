An intrusion prevention system is an active protection system. It attempts to identify threats based on monitoring either a host or a network and can use signature, anomaly, or policy detection methods.

Unlike an IDS, IPS takes action to block or remediate identified threats.

IPS is considered to be an active monitoring device, meaning that traffic flows through it. An IPS device has the ability to drop traffic inline to prevent any malicious packets from reaching their destination.
