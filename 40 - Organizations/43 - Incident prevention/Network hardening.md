Network hardening is the practice of making a network more secure and harder to break into.

# Techniques
There are dozens of ways to harden a network:
- Change the default credentials
- Avoid using common usernames and passwords
- Upgrade firmware
- Patch and update OS and applications
- Disable unnecessary network services
- Use secure protocols
- Secure SNMP
- Generate new keys/credentials every so often
- Disable unneeded switch ports
- Ensure spanning tree protections
- Enable DHCP snooping
- Use VLAN segmentation
- Use port security
- Use router advertisement guard (RA Guard)
- Use dynamic ARP inspection (DAI)
- Use control plane policing (CoPP)
- Use private VLANs
- Change the default VLAN
- Use access control lists (ACLs)
- Use role-based access (RBAC)
- Use firewall rules


# Wireless techniques
- Use MAC filtering
- Consider antenna placement
- Adjust power levels
- Use wireless client isolation
- Use guest network isolation
- Rotate and secure the use of preshared keys (PSKs)
- Use extensible authentication protocol (EAP)
- Use captive portals
- Control IoT access
