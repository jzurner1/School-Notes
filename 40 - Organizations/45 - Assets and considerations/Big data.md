Data is a set of qualitative or quantitative variables of any sort, just a specific set or sets of individual data points.

Big data, on the other hand, is a massive amount of data that accumulates so rapidly that it cannot be structured using traditional software.

Big data can also be a summary term to describe a set of tools, methodologies and techniques for deriving new insights out of those massive data sets as well as combining multiple massive data sets.
