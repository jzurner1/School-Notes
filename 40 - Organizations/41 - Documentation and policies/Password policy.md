A business policy that stipulates the required complexity of passwords in order to ensure security. Complexity may include length, mix of uppercase/lowercase letters, symbols, duration before expiration, etc.

A password policy should include the following:
- Education for end users
- Strong password requirements
- Password expiration
- No previously used passwords
- No words spelled out completely within the password
- A mix of characters

The policy may also detail the use of password management software, which stores passwords for different resources and can help users generate complex passwords. This software must be protected with a strong password that should be memorized.
