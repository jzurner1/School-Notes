A type of documentation for planning and policy creation to accomodate thoughtful and warranted changes to a network's infrastructure and/or configurations.

It is used to ensure that a network runs in good health and to make sure that documentation reflects the true and current state of the objects it is describing. It is very important for security responses and troubleshooting.

It usually includes a documented reason for a change, the actual change request, the approval process, the required maintenance window, and the change notification process.
