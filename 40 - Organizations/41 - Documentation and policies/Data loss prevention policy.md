A data loss prevention policy (DLP) is a policy that focuses on accidental or malicious data loss. The policy considers internal and external users as well as defines practices to guard against the loss or damage of sensitive data.

The best DLP policies also cover wide network integration and are not limited to certain areas of networking, such as email.

Most DLP policies focus on the use of content-level scanning and deep content inspections (DCI) to identify sensitive data and to protect it. DLP policies target activities at three levels:
- Client level, which is data in operation and processing
- Network level, which is data in transit/motion
- Storage level, which is data at rest

# Design
The following actions should be taken when designing a DLP policy for an organization:
- Consider any risk assessments your organization has performed
- Incorporate key members of management from the various departments of your organization
- Identify the organization's most sensitive data
- Outline a phased implementation of DLP and incorporate guidelines for tracking success of the initiative
- Attempt to minimize any negative impacts on business caused by the policy implementation
- Periodically review the DLP policy
- Include the appropriate event-monitoring specifics as they apply to the policy
