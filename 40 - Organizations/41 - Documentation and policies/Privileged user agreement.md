A PUA is a policy signed by privileged users in an IT department, generally network administrators and others with similar powers.

It should include the following:
- Privileged access should only be given to users who read and sign the agreement
- Privileged access may be used only to perform job duties
- Privileged access should only be used if other methods will not work
- Privileged access may be used to perform standard system-related duties only on machines and networks for which the individual is assigned responsibility
- Privileged access may be used to grant, change or deny resources, access, or privilege to another individual only for authorized activities
