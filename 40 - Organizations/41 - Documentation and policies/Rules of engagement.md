The rules of engagement (ROE) is a document created in the beginning of a penetration test that decides how the engagement is to be carried out. There are three main sections.

- **Permission**: Gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out. It is essentially to legally protect individuals and organizations for the activities that are going to be carried out.
- **Test scope**: Annotates specific targets that the engagement applies to. For example, a penetration test may only apply to certain devices on a network.
- **Rules**: Defines exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement. For example, phishing attacks may be prohibited to protect employees.
