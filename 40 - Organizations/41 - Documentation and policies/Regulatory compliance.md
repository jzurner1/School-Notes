- **Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX)**: A federal law designed to protect investors from fraudulent corporate accounting practices. It applies to all publicly traded companies and public accounting firms that do business in the United States. Some provisions even apply to private companies. From an IT perspective, Sarbanes-Oxley primarily regulates the preservation, auditing, and disclosure of financial records and related communications. Data protected by the act cannot be deleted for a set period after its creation, and neither it nor accounting software can be modified without an appropriately documented process.
- **Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)**: A law applying to all federal agencies. It requires every agency to develop, document, and implement an information security and protection program. Each agency can establish its own program, but the act provides guidelines for minimum standards and cost-effectiveness. It also provides guidelines for information security reviews and reporting to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
- **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**: A federal law designed to protect the health insurance coverage of workers who change or lose their jobs. The important part from an IT perspective is how it protects the privacy of patient records. HIPAA defines protected health information (PHI) and regulates how it can be used or disclosed. It also defines security standards for the storage and access of PHI.
- **Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)**: A federal privacy law that governs access to educational records held by any school or other educational institution. The act requires that adult students or the parents of minor students have access to their records and strictly limits how those records can be shared with others without their consent. FERPA describes guidelines for what data must be protected and how it may be disclosed.
- **Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)**: A law designed to protect the customers of financial institutions. It requires that such institutions meet minimum standards to safeguard the personal information of their clients and customers. It also requires them to inform customers about how their data will be stored, used, or shared.
- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: A newly enacted European Union privacy law governing all individual data relating to EU residents. It addresses the security, privacy, and export of such data. The GDPR is even important to American companies since it specifically applies foreign organizations that do business with or market to EU residents. Internet commerce means that this may also apply to organizations that have no physical presence in the EU.
- **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**: The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard isn’t a law; instead, it’s a set of shared rules developed by the world’s major credit card companies and administered by the PCI Council. PCI DSS compliance is part of the contract an organization must sign before processing payment cards. The standard itself regulates how payment information must be stored, processed, and transmitted. It also requires a specific standard of vulnerability scanning.
