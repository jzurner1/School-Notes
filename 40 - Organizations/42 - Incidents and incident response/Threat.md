Anything that can harm an asset such as a thief or a fire.

# Threat sources

The NIST defines four threat sources that may each have a severe impact.
- **Adverserial**: Attacks from malicious users, inside or outside the organization
- **Accidental**: Errors made by users who did not intend to hurt organizational security
- **Structural**: Failures of hardware, software, or other equipment such as environmental controls which are directly controlled by the organization
- **Environmental**: Natural disasters, or structural failures to resources the organization depends on but does not control, such as power or network access

# Threat vectors
In addition to knowing the threats you face, you need to know their vectors.

- **Direct access**: A threat that comes from a source that can directly contact your resource. This is usually someone that is physically inside your organization, able to access hardware, use local interfaces, and personally interact with employees.
- **Wired and wireless networks**: A threat that does not have direct access to IT resource may still affect them over the local network or the internet. Network threats can include remote access, data breachers, and network service outages, among others.
- **Email/personal communications**: Email, internet messaging, telephone, and every other communication  tools can be used to attack the organization. Email is the primary communications-related threat vector, used for spreading malware, credential theft, phishing, and more.
- **Social media**: Social media platforms include common threats such as scanning postings for sensitive information useful in other attacks, spreading misinformation that hurts public relations, or performing social engineering like any other communication channgel.
- **Supply chains**: An organization's vendors, outside contractors, and customers can be used to attack you. Possible methods include leaking data, infiltrating the vendor's organizations, and so on.
- **Removable media and mobile devices**: Any kind of electronic device which can be connected to your computing and network infrastructure can be used to attack it. A USB flash drive found in the parking lot might have malware or built-in hacking hardware.
- **Cloud services**: A service on the cloud is just a service on someone else's computer. It is vulnerable to the same threats that on-premises services are, and it can be attacker through the cloud service provider.

# Threat awareness
It's important to know what threats are common and which aren't.

- **Known threats**: Long-established threats can still be potent against weak security, or if a new attack variant emerges. Trojans, password crackers, and SQL injection have been around forever but keep causing data breaches. Known threat intelligence relies heavily on internal monitoring.
- **Current vulnerabilities**: Documented vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or procedures are continually changing, so you must remain aware of them. Threat feeds and other cybersecurity resources can help you learn what they are, while vulnerability scans and penetration tests can help you verify their existence in your network.
- **Trending attacks**: Attackers frequently adopt new strategies as defenses and vulnerabilities change. If your attackers are utilizing more targeted spearphishing techniques, or if more robust server-side security is leading to more client-side attacks on web applications, you need to recognize and prioritize those threats.
- **Emerging threat sources**: Ongoing changes in technologies and business practices can affect both individual attacks and the security landscape. Adapting to them might require new training, updated security controls, or even a complete rethinking of your security posture.
- **Zero-day vulnerabilities**: Newly discovered vulnerabilities are an especially dangerous threat. Zero-day vulnerabilities are those that are utilized or at least published before even the software vendors know they exist.
