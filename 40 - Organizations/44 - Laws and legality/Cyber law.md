Cyber law is formally defined as the field of dealing with the internet encompassing cases, statutes, regulations, and disputes that affect people and businesses interacting through computers. It addresses issues of online speech and business that arise due to the nature of the medium, most notably intellectual property rights, free speech, privacy, safety, and anonymity.

Alternatively, it can simply be defined as any law that applies to the internet and internet-related techniques.

# Jurisdiction
Jurisdiction is the first question in any lawsuit, a question as to whether or not a court has the power to hear a dispute and resolve it.

### Subject matter jurisdiction
Jurisdiction over the nature of the case, specifically, the extent to which a court can rule on the conduct of people or the status of things. For example, federal district courts have exclusive jurisdiction to decide patent infringement cases.

### Personal jurisdiction
A court's power to bind a defendant with its ruling, specifically, a defendant's personal rights and/or property interests. In cyber law, this is often used when websites and e-commerce are involved.

# Agreements
Contracts on the internet usually fall under one of two categories, clickwrap and browserwrap agreements.

### Clickwrap agreement
A clickwrap agreement is a website wherein a user must select an "I agree" box after being presented with a list of terms and conditions.

### Browserwrap agreement
A browserwrap agreement is where a website's terms and conditions of use are posted on the website via a hyperlink at the bottom of the screen. This does not require the user to press any buttons, and the user agrees to the terms by continuing to browse the website.

A complication with this form of agreement is making sure that the user has actually read the terms and conditions. There is no way to prove that a user actually consents to the terms and conditions without them clicking a button.
