Intellectual property (IP) includes areas like inventions, literature, music, and businesses.

### Copyright
Copyright is the main form of IP cyber law. Copyrights protect almost any piece of IP that can be transmitted over the internet such as books, music, movies, blocks, and so on.

### Patents
Patents are generally used to protect an invention. On the internet, they are usually used for software and new online business methods.

### Trademarks/service marks
Trademarks and service marks are used the same online as they are in the real world. Trademarks will be used for websites and service marks will be used for websites that provide services.

### Trade secrets
Trade secret laws are used to protect multiple forms of IP. This includes formulas, patterns, and processes. This does not protect against reverse engineering.

### Domain disputes
This is related to trademarks, and is specifically about who owns a web address.

### Contracts
Contracts work the same online as they do in real life, but more often with terms of service.

### Privacy
Online organizations are required to protect their users' privacy.

### Employment
Some employee contract terms are linked to cyber law, specifically those with non-disclosure and non-compete clauses. These often include the internet as well as how employees use their company email or other resources.

### Defamation
Slander and libel law has been updated to include the internet.

### Data retention
Handling data online doesn't work the same as it does in the real world. For example, there are no laws that require keeping electronic records forever, unlike physical records.
