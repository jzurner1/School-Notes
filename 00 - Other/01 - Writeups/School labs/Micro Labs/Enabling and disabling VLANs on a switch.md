# Description
In this lab, you will learn to enable and disable VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) on a switch. VLANs are logical subdivisions of a switch that segregate ports from one another as if they were in different LANs. VLANs offer another way to add a layer of separation between sensitive devices and the rest of the network.
