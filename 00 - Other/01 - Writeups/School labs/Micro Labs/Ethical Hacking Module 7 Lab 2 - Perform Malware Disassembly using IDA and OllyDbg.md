# Description
Static analysis also includes the dismantling of a given executable into binary format to study its functionalities and features. This process helps identify the language used for programming the malware, look for APIs that reveal its function, and retrieve other information. Based on the reconstructed assembly code, you can inspect the program logic and recognize its threat potential. This process uses debugging tools such as IDA Pro and OllyDbg.

IDA As a disassembler, IDA explores binary programs, for which the source code might not be available, to create maps of their execution. The primary purpose of a disassembler is to display the instructions actually executed by the processor in a symbolic representation called “assembly language.” However, in real life, things are not always simple. Hostile code usually does not cooperate with the analyst. Viruses, worms, and Trojans are often armored and obfuscated; as such, more powerful tools are required. The debugger in IDA complements the static analysis capabilities of the disassembler. By allowing an analyst to single-step through the code being investigated, the debugger often bypasses the obfuscation. It helps obtain data that the more powerful static disassembler will be able to process in depth.

OllyDbg OllyDbg is a debugger that emphasizes binary code analysis, which is useful when source code is unavailable. It traces registers, recognizes procedures, API calls switches, tables, constants, and strings, and locates routines from object files and libraries.

# Process
1. Open the Windows 10 machine
2. Open IDA freeware
3. Press "New" to select a file
4. Select a malware file, in this case face.exe
5. Keep the default options and hit "OK" to open the file
6. In the IDA View-A window, right-click anywhere and hit "Text view"
7. Minimize the IDA window and navigate to qwingraph.exe, in this case in the same folder as IDA
8. Copy the qwingraph.exe file and paste it in IDA's installation location
9. Reopen the IDA window and navigate to view -> graphs -> flow chart
10. In the new graph window, zoom in to browse the information
11. Close the graph window and navigate to view -> graphs -> function calls
12. In the new call flow window, zoom in to observe the function call flow
13. Close the WinGraph32 call flow window
14. Click the HexView-1 tab to view the hex value of the malicious file
15. Click on the structures tab to view the structure of the file
16. Click on the enums tab to view the Windows enum results
17. Close all the open windows
18. Open OllyDbg
19. In the main window, hit file -> open and select tini.exe
20. Maximize the window, then hit view -> log
21. In the log data window, observe the log details
22. Close the log data window, then hit view -> executable modules
23. In the executable modules window, observe the executable modules
24. Double-click any module to view its complete information
