A wrapper is used to bind the executable of [[Malware|malware]] with exe applications that appear genuine, such as games or office applications.

When the user runs the wrapped exe application, it first installs the [[Trojan|trojan]] in the background and then runs the wrapping application in the foreground. Any binary can be compressed with the right tools, such as petite.exe. This tool decompresses the exe file at run time, making it possible for the trojan to get in virtually undetected.
