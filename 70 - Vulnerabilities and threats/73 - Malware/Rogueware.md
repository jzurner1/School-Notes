A form of [[Malware|malware]] that attempts to convince the victim that there is a virus on their computer, and that they should pay for a fake malware removal tool to get rid of it.

This is different from a general hoax attack because the victim doesn't just download the tool; they also pay for it to remove the "malware" on their system.
