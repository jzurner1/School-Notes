Stealth malware is a type of malware that contains features to hide their effects from antimalware applications. They carefully mask the modifications they make to the system, move themselves to different file systems or memory locations to avoid detection, or even intercept operating system calls to fool other applications into thinking everything is working normally.

Some stealth malware can anchor itself so firmly into a system that it can only be reliably detected by running anti-malware from clean media.
