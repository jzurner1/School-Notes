A trojan proxy is a standalone application that allows remote attackers to use the victim's computer as a [[Proxy server|proxy]] to connect to the target machine.

Usually, an attacker will compromise several computers and use them as hidden proxy servers, over which they have full control and can launch attacks on other systems in the victim's network.
