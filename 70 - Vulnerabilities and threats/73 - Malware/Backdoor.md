A backdoor is any hidden way into a system or application that bypasses standard authentication processes. Originally a backdoor was a secret access method created by an application programmer for malicious or legitimate troubleshooting reasons.

In terms of malware, it refers to a form of payload that creates such a backdoor for attackers to exploit later. One popular form is a RAT, which invisibly installs a remote access program.
