Point-of-sale trojans are a type of [[Trojan|Trojan]] that target point-of-sale (POS) and payment equipment such as card readers.

The magnetic stripe on credit cards consists of two tracks, one called TRACK1 and the other called TRACK2. Each of these contain critical information related to the credit card. Once a POS trojan infects a POS device, it attempts to grab TRACK1 and TRACK2 information of the card that gets inserted in the device.
