A payload is the malicious actions that malware takes and the effects it has. Malware effects can range from slowdowns and minor annoyances to data breaches, system failure, or even physical damage.

Most payloads do similar types of damage. They consume system resources, introduce instability, delete or corrupt data, or display unwanted messages. They may also disable anti-virus or other security controls, making the system more vulnerable to other malware.

Other payloads have specific effects that are notable enough to be used to name the malware itself. These include backdoors, command and control, botnets, ransomware, spyware, adware, and browser security compromises.
