IoT trojans are a type of [[Trojan|Trojan]] that target [[Internet of Things|IoT]] devices and networks. They can then leverage a botnet to attack other machines outside of the IoT network.

One well-known IoT trojan is known as Mirai. It is a self-propagating IoT botnet that infects poorly protected IoT devices. It uses the [[Telnet|Telnet]] ports 23 and 2323 to find devices that use default credentials and infect them to coordinate [[DDoS|DDoS]] attacks.
