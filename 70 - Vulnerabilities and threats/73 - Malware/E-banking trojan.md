A type of [[Trojan|trojan]] that intercept a victim's e-banking account information before the system can encrypt it. The trojan then sends the information to the attacker's [[Command and control|C2]] center.

Typically, a banking trojan uses the following:
- **TAN grabber** - A transaction authentication number (TAN) is a single-use password for authenticating online banking transactions. Banking trojans intercept valid TANs entered by users and replace them with random numbers, which the bank will reject.
- **HTML injection** - The trojan creates fake form fields on e-banking pages, enabling the attacker to collect the target's account details, credit card number, date of birth, and so on. The attacker can use this information to impersonate the target.
- **Form grabber** - A type of malware that caprutes a target's sensitive data such as IDs and passwords from a web browser form or page. It is an advanced method for collecting the target's internet banking information. It analyses POST requests and responses to the victim's browser, and compromises the scramble pad authentication and intercepts the scramble pad input as the user enters their ID and PIN.
- **Covert credential grabber** - A type of malware that remains dormant until the user performs an online financial transaction. Works covertly to replicate itself on the computer and edits the registry entries each time the computer is started. Also searches the cookie files that have been stored on the computer while browsing financial websites.
