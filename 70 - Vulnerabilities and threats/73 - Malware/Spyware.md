Spyware is related to a backdoor, but instead of remote access, it is designed to gather information about user and computer activities to send to other parties.

Spyware can track browser activity, redirect network traffic, steal financial or user account information, or capture user input. Sometimes tracking cookies used by web browsers are classified as spyware. In addition, keyloggers are a form of spyware.

It is a common part of PUPs.
