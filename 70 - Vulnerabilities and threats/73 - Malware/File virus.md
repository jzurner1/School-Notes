A file virus is a type of [[Virus|Virus]] that infects files that are executed or interpreted in the system, such as .com, .exe, .sys, .ovl, .obj, .prg, .mnu, and .bat files. They can be direct-action (non-resident) or memory-resident viruses.

File viruses inject their code into the original file and infect executable files. They infect in a variety of ways and are found in a number of file types. The most common type of file virus operates by identifying the file type it can infect most easily, such as that with filenames ending in .com or .exe.

File viruses hide their presence using stealth techniques to reside in a computer's memory in the same way as a [[Boot sector virus|system sector virus]].
