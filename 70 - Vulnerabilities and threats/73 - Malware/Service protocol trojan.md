A service protocol trojan is a type of [[Trojan|Trojan]] takes advantage of vulnerable service protocols such as VNC, [[HTTP|HTTP]], [[HTTPS|HTTPS]], and [[ICMP|ICMP]].

- **VNC trojan** - A VNC trojan starts a VNC server daemon in the victim's system, which the attacker connects to using any VNC viewer. Since the VNC program is a known utility, the trojan will be difficult to detect with antivirus software.
- **HTTP/HTTPS trojan** - HTTP/HTTPS trojans can bypass any firewall and work in reverse, as opposed to a straight HTTP tunnel. They use web-based interfaces and port 80. The execution of these trojans takes place on the internal host and spawns a child program at a predetermined time. The firewall sees the child program as a user, and allows it access to the internet. The child program executes a local shell, connects to the webserver that the attacker owns on the internet through a legitimate HTTP request, and sends it a ready signal. This answer for the attacker's server looks legitimate but is actualyl a series of commands that the child can execute on the machine's local shell. The attacker converts all the traffic into a [[Base64 encoding|Base64]]-like structure.
