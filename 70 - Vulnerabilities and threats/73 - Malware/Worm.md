A worm is similar to a virus except it doesn't require human interaction to replicate. A worm spreads by replicating itself through system vulnerabilities.

A worm might initially require an infected file to be run, but once it's running, it can spread through the network unassisted, exploiting vulnerable protocols or services. Because of how they spread, worms are generally considered network attacks as well as malware.
