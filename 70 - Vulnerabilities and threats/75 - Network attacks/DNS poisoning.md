DNS poisoning, also known as DNS spoofing or DNS cache poisoning, is a type of attack where an attacker submits incorrect information to a DNS cache so that DNS queries to that cache will return an incorrect response. This will redirect users from their intended website to a malicious one by providing the incorrect IP address.
