Eavesdopping takes advantage of the idea that sensitive information is often sent around a network and can be passively listened to.

Eavesdropping requires the attacker to be on-path, or at least have access to a node or link carrying the targeted traffic. This can be done by plugging into an interface, physically tapping a cable, or just getting in range of wireless transmissions or RF emanations of a wired connection.

Many protocols send sensitive data in unencrypted plaintext that can be intercepted and read by attackers. These protocols include HTTP, FTP, Telnet, POP, IMAP, SLIP, and SNMPv1 and v2. Secure protocols using encrypted data are safer but not fully protected.
