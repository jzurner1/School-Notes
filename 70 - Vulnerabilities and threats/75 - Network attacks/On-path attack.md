An on-path attack, also known as a man-in-the-middle attack, is a type of attack where an attacker gets on a direct path between a client and server to eavesdrop on a conversation.

If the information is encrypted, the attack may be able to fool the client and the server into making VPNs to the attacker instead of each other, allowing the attacker to see the data in plaintext.

On a local Ethernet network, a number of methods may be used to redirect a client's traffic through the attacker instead of directly to the server; these methods include ARP spoofing, ARP cache poisoning, DHCP spoofing, DNS spoofing, and DNS poisoning.
