Privilege escalation is the act of exploiting something to gain elevated access to resources that are normally unavailable. For example, a user may be able to use privilege escalation to delete other accounts, something that they wouldn't be able to do without it.

There are two main forms of privilege escalation:
- **Horizontal privilege escalation** is the action of getting access to resources and functions of a user with similar access permissions, such as accessing one bank account from another
- **Vertical privilege escalation** is the action of getting access to resources and functions of a user with higher privileges, such as going from a user account to an administrative account

Common methods of privilege escalation include [[Privilege escalation using DLL hijacking|DLL hijacking]], [[Privilege escalation using dylib hijacking|dylib hijacking]], the Spectre vulnerability, and the Meltdown vulnerability.
