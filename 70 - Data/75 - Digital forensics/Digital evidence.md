Digital information found on a digital device, often used in computer forensics. It can include emails, audio files, metadata, databases, spreadsheets, system logs, and so on.

In addition, mobile devices can store a couple hundred of the last cell locations that they accessed, which in turn can be read by investigators to learn location history.
