A unit of information is a measured number of bits containing data.

Traditionally, bits and the larger versions (kilobits, megabits, etc) are used to talk about speed, such as megabits per second. Bytes are use for storage.

There are a number of other data units to know:

| Name   | Size in bits | Signed? |
| ------ | ------------ | ------- |
| Byte   | 8            | No      |
| SByte  | 8            | Yes     |
| Word   | 16           | No      |
| SWord  | 16           | Yes     |
| DWord  | 32           | No      |
| SDWord | 32           | Yes     |
| FWord  | 48           | Unknown |
| QWord  | 64           | Unknown |
| TByte  | 80           | Unknown |
| Real4  | 32           | Unknown |
| Real8  | 64           | Unknown |
