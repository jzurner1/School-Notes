A unit of information is a measured number of bits containing [[data|data]].

Traditionally, bits and the larger versions (kilobits, megabits, etc) are used to talk about speed, such as megabits per second. Bytes are use for storage.

There are a number of other data units to know:

| Name   | Size in bits | Signed? |
| ------ | ------------ | ------- |
| Byte   | 8            | No      |
| SByte  | 8            | Yes     |
| Word   | 16           | No      |
| SWord  | 16           | Yes     |
| DWord  | 32           | No      |
| SDWord | 32           | Yes     |
| FWord  | 48           |  |
| QWord  | 64           |  |
| TByte  | 80           |  |
| Real4  | 32           |  |
| Real8  | 64           |  |
