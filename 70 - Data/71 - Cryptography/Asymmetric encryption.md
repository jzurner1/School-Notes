Asymmetric encryption, also known as public/private key pairs, is slower than symmetric encryption but provides better security. It uses different keys for the sender and receiver. Because of its speed, it is not usually used for real-time data; rather, it is usually used to encrypt smaller chunks of data. This smaller chunk of data may be used to authenticate the other party in a conversation or to exchange a shared key during a session.

### RSA
The most popular method of asymmetric encryption is RSA, named after its creators. RSA is commonly used as part of a public key infrastructure (PKI) system, specifically used for digital certificates and certificate authority (CA) for authentication and encryption services.
