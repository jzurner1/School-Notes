Also known as a shift cipher, a Caesar cipher is one of the easiest forms of encryption to break.

It is done by taking a message and substituting it for another letter further down in the alphabet that is a certain distance away. For example, the message `HELLO WORLD`, with a key of 4, would translate to `LIPPS ASVPH`.
