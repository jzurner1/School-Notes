Symmetric encryption, also called private or secret keys, is faster than asymmetric encryption but less secure. It means that both the sender and the receiver use the same key to encrypt or decrypt a packet.

### DES
Data encryption standard is an older algorithm that uses a 56-bot key and is now considered deprecated

### 3DES
Triple DES uses three 56-bot keys for a total of 168 bits and is stronger than DES. It has three keying options: 1) all three keys can be different, 2) two of the three keys may be the same, or 3) all three keys may be the same to maintain backward compatibility with DES

### AES
Advanced encryption standard is the preferred symmetric encryption algorithm. It is available with 128-, 192-, and 256-bit keys, where 128 is moderately strong and 256 is considered unbreakable. It is used for many applications such as wireless, mobile, VPNs, and web security applications.
