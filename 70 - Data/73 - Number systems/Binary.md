Base 2, a number system represented by 1's and 0's (bits). Makes up the foundation of computers and the physical layer of the OSI model.

Below is an example of current state modulation, where 1's and 0's are represented by voltage being present or absent, respectively.

Alternatively there is state transition modulation, where any change in voltage represents a 1 and no change represents a 0.
