An [[encoding|encoding]] practice; the process of assigning numbers to graphical characters, specifically bits to alphanumeric characters.

A character set is defines a standard code used to interpret and display characters in a language. There are a number of sets, but these are the most common:

### ASCII
The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) uses 7 bits to store characters found in the English language.

### Unicode
An international standard that uses a 3-byte code and can represent every character known to be in use in all countries of the world.

### UTF
The Unicode Transformation Format (UTF), which transforms the long Unicode vlaues into either 1-byte (UTF-8) or 2-byte (UTF-16) simplified codes. In English-speaking countries, ASCII is being replaced by UTF-8.
