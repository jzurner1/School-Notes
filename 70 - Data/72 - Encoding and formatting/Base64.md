Base64 is a form of [[encoding|encoding]] that represents binary data in sequences of 24 bits that can be represented by four 6-bit Base64 digits.

Most forms of Base64 use A-Z, a-z, and 0-9 for the first 62 possible values (0-61). The last two vary depending on the version. For example, the Base64 alphabet defined in RFC 4648 uses + and / for the values 62 and 63, respectively.
