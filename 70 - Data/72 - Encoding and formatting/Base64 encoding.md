Base64 is a form of [[encoding|encoding]] that represents binary data in as a string of ASCII characters. The purpose of Base64 is to allow binery data to be represented and transmitted as text so that it can be stored or transmitted over systems that only support alphanumeric characters.

Base64 converts binary data to strings of ASCI characters using a specific mapping of bytes to characters.

For example, the string "Hello world" would be converted to `SGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=`.
