This is a type of network architecture with three tiers. It is also called the classic or classical model or the hierarchical network model.

The three tiers are the access layer, the distribution layer, and the core layer.

## Access layer
The access layer, also known as the edge layer, is the bottom layer that ensures that authorized users can access the network with ease and in a high-bandwidth fashion. Devices at this layer include end-user devices such as laptops, desktops, smartphones, and tablets; inexpensive layer 2 switches (also called access layer switches); and wireless access points. Common technologies at this layer include layer 2 switching, spanning tree protocol, Power over Ethernet, VLANs, QoS functions, port security, and VLAN access control lists.

## Distribution layer
The middle layer is known as the distribution layer, or the aggregation layer. This layer is responsible for connecting the access layer and the devices inside it to remote data, such as that in cloud storage. At this layer you can find high-speed routers, high-speed multilayer switches, firewalls, intrusion prevention devices, and proxy servers. This layer is known for the technologies for security, policy, routing, load balancing, redundancy, and summarization.

## Core layer
The top layer is called the core layer, where speed is the most important thing. It is responsible for moving large amounts of data in an enterprise network, usually between a datacenter and the main employee locations. The fastest routers and multilayer switches exist here as well as more reduncancy, bandwidth aggregation, and traffic policing.


## Two-tiered model
Most organizations are small enough that they can combine the core and distribution layers into a two-tiered model. This is cheaper and simpler to manage.
