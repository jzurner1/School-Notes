- Also known as a dedicated line
- Dedicated point-to-point (P2P) link, which is a connection between two nodes
- Fixed-bandwidth data connection, meaning a set amount of bandwidth is allocated
- Not a dedicated cable, but a reserved dedicated line circuit
- Uses two pairs of wires, one in each direction, for full-duplex operation
- Provides a layer 1 service, promising to deliver bits between the connected devices
	- Because of this, many organizations have created data-link layer protocols for leased lines such as [[HDLC|HDLC]]
