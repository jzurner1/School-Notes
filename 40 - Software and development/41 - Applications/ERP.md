Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a type of software that assists in running a business. This is done by supporting automation and various processes in many fields, including finance, HR, manufacturing, supply chain, and more.

ERPs collect information from various departments into a common database, allowing executives to monitor everything going on with the business.
