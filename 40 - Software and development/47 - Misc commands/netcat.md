Netcat, also known as nc, has a number of applications that can be very valuable. It supports both TCP and UDP protocols, can function as a client that connects to a listening port, act as a server that listens on a port of your choice, and so on. It can be used as a simple client or server over TCP or UDP.

To run netcat as a client, the command is `nc <target IP> <port number>`.
To run netcat as a server, the command is `nc -lvnp <port number>`.
