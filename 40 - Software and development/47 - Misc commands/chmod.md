chmod is a Linux command that allows you to change the read, write, and execute (rwx) permissions of a file or directory.

The syntax of the command is `chmod [options] <rwx mode> <file>`. You can change multiple files at once with `chmod [options] <rwx mode>, <rwx mode> <file1> <file2>`.

To see the rwx permissions of a file, use the command `ls -l <filename>`.
