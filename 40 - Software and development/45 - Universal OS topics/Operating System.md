The OS is the most important piece of software on a computer. Without it, no applications can run and no hardware will work.

Some important tasks that the operating system does are recognizing input (keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, etc), controlling the output to the display, keeping track of folders and files, managing applications, and controlling peripherals such as printers. It is also in charge of the boot process, which is the steps that the computer goes through when it turns on.

The most popular operating systems are Windows, macOS, Linux, Chrome OS, Android, and Apple iOS. Android and iOS are built specifically for mobile devices.

# 32-bit vs 64-bit
Operating systems use either a 32-bit or a 64-bit architecture. The number of bits is determined by the processor.

A 64-bit operating system supports 64-bit processors and features multiple cores, making it better suited for more demanding tasks. A 32-bit operating system can only run programs and use drivers that are made specifically for a 32-bit operating system's instruction set. On the other hand, a 64-bit system can run both 32-bit and 64-bit applications.
