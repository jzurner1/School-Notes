Every software and hardware configuration is stored in a database called the registry. The registry contains things such as folder and file property settings, port configuration, application preferences, and user profiles.

The registry is divided into five subtrees: Hkey_Local_Machine, Hkey_Users, Hkey_Current_User, Hkey_Current_Config, and Hkey_Classes_Root.

The registry can be edited using the `regedit` or `regedt32` commands or the regedit utility.
