A Windows domain is a collection of computers and other resources that are managed as a single unit. It is managed by a [[Domain controller|domain controller]], which is responsible for managing security and access for all the computers and users within the domain.

### Purpose
Windows domains provide a simple way to manage resources on a network within an organization. It enables administrators to set and enforce security policies, manage user and computer accounts, and control access to resources across a network.

### Common uses
1. Network management is easier from a central device. By grouping resources into a domain, administrators can manage them all from a single location.
2. Authentication and authorization are made much easier using a Windows domain, as the users have a single set of credentials to log into the network and can access various resources depending on their permissions.
3. Resource sharing is made much easier as network devices such as printers and files are more readily available through provided mechanisms.
4. Security is also easier, as Windows domains provide a framework for enforcing security policies across the network, including password policies, access control, and more.
