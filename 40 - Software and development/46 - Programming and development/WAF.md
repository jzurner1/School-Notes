A web application firewall (WAF) is a type of application firewall that filters, monitors, and blocks HTTP traffic to and from a web service. This can be used to prevent attacks such as SQL injection, XSS, and more.

A WAF stands between the web application and the client. It can be a separate device or built into another device.
