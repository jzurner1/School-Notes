A web service (WS) is a service running on a computer that can be accessed by other computers over a network.

A few technologies are used. The basics are HTTP and XML, but others include [[SOAP|Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)]] to transfer messages, Web Services Description Language (WSDL) to describe the availability of a service, and Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) for service discovery.

Web services use a standardized XML-based messaging system. Each message sent to and from a web service is encoded into predefined XML and then decoded on arrival.
