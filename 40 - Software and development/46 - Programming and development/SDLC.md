The SDLC (system development life cycle) is a methodology that guides the development of an information system. It is based on a series of activities called life-cycle phases which each represent a stage in the life of an information system. Each successive phase leverages knowledge and documentation from previous phases.

# Purpose
The main purpose of using SDLC is to promote quality during design, development, and implementation. When it is used correcty, an information system is more reliable and cost-effective. A life-cycle approach ensures that there is a clear plan and process for:

- identifying and validating organizational requirements early in the project
- designing and developing the system based on the approved requirements
- deploying and transitioning the completed system to the user community
- operating, maintaining, and updating the system once it is deployed
- decommissioning the system when it is no longer required or when it is replaced

# Phases
The phases of SDLC are the sequence of activites associated with the life cycle of an information system. While the number of activities can vary, there are some common guidelines that allow activities to be grouped into clearly defined phases:

- Complete a preliminary investigation, requirements analysis, and system recommendation.
- Specify a detailed design based on an approved set of requirements.
- Develop the system according to the approved design specification.
- Test the system and gain user acceptance.
- Install, operate, and maintain the accepted system.
- Update or replace the system as organizational goals and requirements change.
- Decommission the system when it is no longer needed.
- Document, report on, and approve each phase of the SDLC before beginning the next phase.

##### Four-Phase Approach
The four-phase approach divides the life cycle into four major phases. It may be used when an organization has a good understanding of its requirements.

##### Nine-Phase Approach
The nine-phase approach divides the life cycle into nine major phases. It is used when an organization is less familiar with a type of information system.

##### Ten-Phase Approach
The ten-phase approach is used by the US Department of Justice on information system implementation projects. It is the same as the nine-phase approach except it adds a phase to dispose of the information system when it is no longer needed.

# SDLC Models
A model is a representation of the SDLC process.

##### Waterfall Model
The waterfall model follows the idea that once each phase is over, there is no turning back; like water over a cliff, it cannot be revisited. The main advantage is that it allows for direct project manager and management control with solid timelines. The main disadvantage is that there is no returning to a previous phase and it is difficult to modify previous steps.

##### Fountain Model
The fountain model recognizes that some overlap may be needed between some development phases and previous phases may have to be revisited through the development cycle. Details about the information system are pushed up through phases but may flow back to previous phases at any time. The main advantage is that changes can easily be made to components of the information system to cover gaps. The main disadvantage is that it may take more time and money to complete the information system and it theoretically may never be completed.
