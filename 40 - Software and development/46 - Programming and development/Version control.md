Version control, also known as source control or revision control, is a method or system that organizes various project files and protects modifications to them.

A version control system (VCS) provides a common central place to store and merge projects files so that you can access the latest project version. It also protects the files so that a file is not overwritten by another developer.

The most popular VCS is [[Git|Git]], which is often used in software development.
