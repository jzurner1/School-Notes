- **Command and control (C2) warfare**: The impact an attacker possesses over a compromised system or network that they control
- **Intelligence-based warfare**: A sensor-based technology that directly corrupts technological systems. It consists of the design, protection, and denial of systems that seek sufficient knowledge to dominate the battlespace
- **Electronic warfare**: The use of radio-electronic and cryptographic techniques to degrade communication. Radio electronic techniques attack the physical means of sending information while cryptographic techniques use bits and byes to disrupt the means of sending information
