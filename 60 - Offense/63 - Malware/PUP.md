A potentially unwanted program (PUP) is a program that isn't necessarily dangerous, but has features or security risks that users may not want or be aware of. They are often called greyware and not always classified as malware.

They are commonly installed as add-ons or wrappers with legitimate free software applications. They do less direct damage than trojans but can steal information, consume system resources, or introduce security vulnerabilities.
