An encryption virus, also known as a cryptolocker virus, is a type of [[virus|virus]] that consists of an encrypted copy and a decryption module. The decryption module remains constatnt, whereas the encryption makes use of different keys.

An encryption key consists of a decryption module and an encrypted copy of the code, which enciphers the virus. When the attacker injects the virus into the target machine, the decryptor, will first execute and decrypt the virus body. Then, the virus body executes and replicates or becomes resident in the target machine. The replication process is successfully accomplished using the encryptor. Each virus-infected file uses a different key for encryption. These viruses employ XOR on each byte with a randomized key. The decryption technique is "x," or each byte with a randomized key is generated and saved by the root virus.
