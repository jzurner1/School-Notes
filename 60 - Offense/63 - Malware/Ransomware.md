Ransomware is an extremely popular type of attack and a form of malware. With it, an attacker locks access to a system or files usually using encryption, or at least pretends to have locked access. The attacker asks for a ransom, usually in cryptocurrency, to get the system or files unlocked.

Ransomware is commonly distributed by trojans and drive-by downloads.
