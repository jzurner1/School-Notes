A botnet, often the result of a backdoor, is a large number of computers that are centrally controlled to achieve a common goal. The infected machines are individually called zombies.

A botnet's controller can direct the zombies to send emails, make DDoS attacks, gather information, or perform distributed computing tasks such as Bitcoin mining, all without the machine's owners knowing.

Many of today's largest network attacks and spam operations are conducted by botnets made up of thousands or millions of zombies.
