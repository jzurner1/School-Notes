Scripts made to be malicious are common forms of malware. They are easy to write or modify and can often bypass controls designed to protect against malicious executables. Many fileless malware attacks happen when an attacker uses some exploit to upload and run a script on a vulnerable computer.

The most common types of scripts are PowerShell, bash, Python, macros, Visual Basic, and JavaScript.
