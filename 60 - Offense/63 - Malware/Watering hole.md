Similar to a drive-by download, a watering hole targets a specific group or category of users. The attack first compromises a website or service used and trusted by the target group. When those users visit the site or service, they are infected via a drive-by download attack.

This attack is particularly effective against more security-oriented users who may let their guard down when visiting familiar websites.
