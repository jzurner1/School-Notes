A trojan masquerades as a harmless or useful program such as a game or anti-virus application, but once the program is run, the malicious functions take over. Usually, the downloaded program will work as advertised, but the harmful function remains inside.

- Count as both malware and social engineering.
- Wrapped within or attached to a legitimate program
- Use victims as unwitting intermediaries to attack others
- Work at the same privilege level as the victims

## Attack process
While there are numerous ways to infect a system with a trojan, the following is a common method:
1. Create a new trojan packet using various tools such as Trojan Horse Construction Kit, Social Engineering Toolkit (SET), and Beast. The newer a trojan is, the less likely it is of being detected.
2. Transfer the trojan to the target system using a dropper or a downloader. The dropper appears to users as a legitimate application, but when it is run, it extracts the malware components hidden within it and executes them, usually without saving them to the disk to avoid detection. Downloaders don't actually contain the malware, but have a link to it; when they are executed, they connect back to the attacker and download the malware.
3. Employ a wrapper to help bind the trojan executable to legitimate files to install it on the target system.
4. Employ a crypter to encrypt the trojan to evade detection by firewalls/IDS.
5. Propagate the trojan by implementing various methods such as sending it via overt and covert channels, exploit kits, emails, and instant messagers.
6. Deploy the trojan on the victim's machine by executing the dropper or downloader. The deployed file contains wrapped and encrypted malware.
7. Execute the damage routing. Depending on the malware, this will usually deliver the payload.


## Common ports
Many notable types of trojans use different ports. Some of the most notable ones are listed below:
