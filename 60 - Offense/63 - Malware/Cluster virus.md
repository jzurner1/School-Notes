A cluster virus is a type of [[virus|virus]] that infects files without changing the file or planting additional files.

They save the virus code to the hard drive and overwrite the pointer in the directory entry, directing the disk read point to the virus code instead of the actual program. Even though the changes in the directory entry may affect all the programs, only one copy of the virus exists on the disk.
