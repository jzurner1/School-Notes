Also known as a system sector virus, a boot sector virus is a type of [[virus|virus]] that exists in the boot sector of a device.

The master boot record (MBR) and the DOS boot record system sectors are common targets for viruses. An operating system executes code in these areas while booting. MBRs are the most virus-prone zones, but the DOS boot sector is also common.

Each sector consists of only 512 bytes of disk space, so system sector viruses conceal their code in some other disk space. These viruses move MBR to another location on the hard disk and copies itself to the original location of the MBR. When the system boots, the virus code executes first and then passes the control to the original MBR.
