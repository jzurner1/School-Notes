Command and control (C2) is an advanced form of backdoor that uses automated processes to establish and maintain remote control of an infected system.

Malware with C2 functions typically send beaconing messages looking for C2 servers belonging to an attacker. Once contact is made, the machine awaits futher instructions such as remote control, data exfiltration, or inside attacks on the local network.
