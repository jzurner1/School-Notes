A virus is a malware program that spreads by infecting files or system areas and then making copies of itself. Some viruses are harmless, some damage files, and some have other goals. They are primarily spread through sharing files, usually through email.

Unlike worms, viruses require some kind of human interaction to spread. This may mean opening a file, visiting a website, and so on.

There are different types of viruses:
- **Program viruses** infect executable files and are activated when the program is run.
- **Boot sector viruses** infect the boot sector of a drive and are activate when the drive is first accessed.
- **Macro viruses** and **script viruses** infect data files used by applications with built-in scripting languages, such as Microsoft office. They are activated when you open the file.
- **Multipartite viruses** can spread multiple ways and infect multiple file types.
