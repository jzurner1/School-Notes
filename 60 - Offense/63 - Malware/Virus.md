A virus is a malware program that spreads by infecting files or system areas and then making copies of itself. Some viruses are harmless, some damage files, and some have other goals. They are primarily spread through sharing files, usually through email.

Unlike worms, viruses require some kind of human interaction to spread. This may mean opening a file, visiting a website, and so on.

## Characteristics
- Infects other programs
- Transforms itself
- Encrypts itself
- Alters data
- Replicates itself
- Corrupts files/programs


## Types
There are different types of viruses:
- **Program viruses** infect executable files and are activated when the program is run.
- **Boot sector viruses** infect the boot sector of a drive and are activate when the drive is first accessed.
- **Macro viruses** and **script viruses** infect data files used by applications with built-in scripting languages, such as Microsoft office. They are activated when you open the file.
- **Multipartite viruses** can spread multiple ways and infect multiple file types.


## Lifecycle
There are six stages from origin to elimination:
1. **Design** - Development of virus code using programming languages or construction kits
2. **Replication** - The virus replicates for a period within the target system and then spreads itself
3. **Launch** - The virus is activate when specific actions are perfomed, such as running an infected program
4. **Detection** - The virus is identified as a threat infecting a target system
5. **Incorporation** - Antivirus software developers create a defense against the virus
6. **Execution of the damage routine** - Users install antivirus updates and eliminate the virus threats

# How they work
Viruses can attack a target system in a variety of ways, such as attaching to programs and transmitting to other programs through specific events. Viruses need events to take place, as they cannot self-start, infect hardware, or transmit themselves through non-executable files.

The events that cause a virus to activate are called triggers or direct attack events. This can include opening an email attachment, running a program, visiting a website, and so on.

## 1. Infection phase
Programs modified by a virus infection can enable virus functionalities to run on the system. The virus infects the target system after it is triggered and becomes active upon the execution of the infected programs, because the program code leads to the virus code.

The two most important factors in the infection phase of a virus are the method of infection and the method of spreading.

##### Infection
Typically, the method for infecting a system involve:
1. The virus loads itself into memory and checks for an executable on the disk
2. The virus appends malicious code to a legitimate program without the permission or knowledge of the user
3. The user is unaware of the replacement and launches the infected program
4. The execution of the infect program also infects other programs in the system
5. The cycle repeats until the user notices and removes it

Specific viruses can infect in different ways:
- A **file virus** infects by attaching itself to an executable system application program, such as source code, batch files, or script files
- **Boot sector viruses** execute their code before the target PC is booted
and so on.

##### Spreading
Viruses spread in a variety of ways. There are virus programs that infect and keep spreading each time the user executes them. Some do not infect on the first program launch; they may reside in a computer's memory and infect programs later.

The most popular methods by which a virus spreads:
- Viruses can infect a variety of different types of files
- Some can take advantage of file servers and file-sharing services to spread between machines
- Portable media such as DVDs and flash drives can spread malware to systems that insert them
- Email and other communication methods can spread viruses, usually along with attachments

## 2. Attack phase
Once a virus spreads throughout a target system, they start corrupting the files and programs of the host system. Some viruses can trigger and c orrupt the host system only after the triggering event is activated, while others have bugs that replicate themselves and perform activities such as deleting files.

Most viruses that infect a system will either delete and alter the content of data files, which will slow down the system, or perform tasks not related to applications.

In the attack phase, viruses execute upon triggering specific events. Some viruses execute and corrupt via built-in bug programs after being stored in the host's memory. The newest ones conceal their presence, only attacking after they thoroughly spread through the host.
