A type of stealth malware that does not permanently save any malicious files to the system's hard drive, evading detection by conventional file-based malware scanning.

Typical examples include malicious scripts loaded into RAM and arbitrary code execution following a memory exploit.

It does not usually persist after a system reboot, but it can include persistence features that make the system easy to reinfect.
