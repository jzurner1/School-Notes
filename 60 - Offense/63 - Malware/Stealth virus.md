Stealth viruses, also known as tunneling viruses, are a type of [[virus|virus]] that try to hide from antivirus programs by actively altering and corrupting the service call interrupts while running. The virus code replaces the requests to perform operations with respect to these service call interrupts. They state false information to hide their presence from antivirus programs.

A stealth virus can hide from antivirus software by hiding the original size of the file or temporarily placing a copy of itself in some other system drive, thus replacing the infected file with the uninfected file that is stored on the hard drive.
