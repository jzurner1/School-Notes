While [[Malware|malware]] can vary in design, it usually includes a number of typical components. Some of the most common include the following:

- **Crypter** - A software program used to conceal the existence of malware. It can be used to elude antivirus detection and can protect malware from reverse engineering or analysis, making it difficult to detect by security mechanisms.
- **Downloader** - A type of [[Trojan|trojan]] that downloads other malware or malicious code and files from the internet to a PC or device. It is usually installed when an attacker first gains access to a system.
- **Dropper** - A covert carrier of malware. Attackers embed malware files inside droppers, which perform the installation covertly. Attackers need to first install the malware program or code on the system to execute the dropper. It can transport malware code and execute malware on a target system without being detected by antivirus scanners.
- **Exploit** - Part of malware that contains code or a sequence of commands that can take advantage of a bug or vulnerability in a digital system. Attackers use such code to breach the system's security through software vulnerabilities to spy on information or install malware. Based on the type of vulnabilities abused, exploits can be categorized as local or remote.
- **Injector** - A program that injects exploits or malicious code available in the malware into other vulnerable running processes and changes the method of execution to hide or prevent its removal.
- **Obfuscator** - A program that conceals the malicious code of malware via various techniques, making it difficult for security mechanisms to detect or remove it.
- **Packer** - Software that compresses the malware file to convert the code and data of the malware into an unreadable format; uses compression techniques to pack the malware.
- **Payload** - Part of the malware that performs the desired activity when activated. May be used for deleting or modifying files, degrading the system performance, opening ports, changing settings, and so on, to compromise system security.
- **Malicious code** - A piece of code that defines the basic functionality of the malware and comprises commands that result in security breaches. It can take the form of Java Applets, ActiveX controls, browser plugins, or pushed content, among others.
