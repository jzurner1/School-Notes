A multipartite virus, also known as a multipart virus or a hybrid virus, is a type of [[virus|virus]] that combines the approach of [[File virus|file viruses]] and [[Boot sector virus|boot sector viruses]].

Specifically, they attempt to simultaneously attack both the boot sector and the executable of program files. When the virus infects the boot sector, it will, in turn, affect the system files and vice versa. This type of virus will reinfect a system repeatedly if it is not rooted out entirely from the target machine.
