A downloader is a program that can download and install [[malware|malware]] onto a device.

They are similar to [[dropper|droppers]], the main difference being that the downloader doesn't actually contain any malware within it, just the link to the malware. This makes it easier for unknown downloaders to pass through anti-malware scanners.
