Network scanning, specifically while in the scanning phase of [[Hacking phases|ethical hacking]], is a type of [[Scanning|scanning]] directed at networks.

It can be used to identify hosts, ports, services, active machines, and software running on those machines.

## Objectives
The more information that is known about a network, the higher the chances are of succeeding in gaining unauthorized access to it. Some objectives to gather more information include:
- Discover the network's live hosts, IP addresses, and open ports of those live hosts. Using these open ports, the attacker can determine the best means of entering the system.
- Discover the OS and system architecture of the target. This is also known as fingerporinting. An attacker can formulate an attack strategy based on the OS's known vulnerabilities.
- Discover the services running/listening on the target system. Doing this gives the attacker an indication of the vulnerabilities that can potentially be exploited to gain access to the target system.
- Identify specific applications or versions of a particular service.
- Identify vulnerabilities in any of the network systems, which can help an attacker to compromise the target system or network through various exploits.
