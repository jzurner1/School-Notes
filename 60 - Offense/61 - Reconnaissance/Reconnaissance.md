Recon is a preliminary survey to gather information on a target. It is the first step in getting a foothold on a system.

# Passive recon
Passive recon relies on publicly available knowledge that can be accessed without directly engaging with the target.

This may include using DNS lookup to find DNS records of a domain from a public DNS server (using the `whois` command), checking job ads for a company, or reading relevent news articles.

# Active recon
Active recon relies on engaging with the target.

This may include connecting to the company servers such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP, calling the company for social engineering, and entering the premises.
