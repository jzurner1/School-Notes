Whois is a query and response protocol used for querying databases that store information about an internet resource such as domain name, IP address block, and so on. It listens on TCP port 43.

There are two types of data models used to store and look up Whois information. The first is **thick Whois**, which stores the complete Whois information from all the registrars for a particular set of data. The other type is **thin Whois**, which only stores the name of the Whois server of the registrar of a domain, which in turn holds complete details on the data being looked up.

A Whois query will return the following data:
- Domain name details
- Contact details of the domain owner
- Domain name servers
- NetRange
- When a domain was created
- Expiry records
- Last time the records were updated
