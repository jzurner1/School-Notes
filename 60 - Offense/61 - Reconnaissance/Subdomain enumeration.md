Subdomain enumeration is the process of finding valid subdomains for a domain, typically for recon purposes.

# Websites
- [DNSDumpster](https://dnsdumpster.com/) is a free tool used to find more information about domains.
- [Shodan.io](https://www.shodan.io/) tries to connect every device reachable online into a search engine.
- [crt.sh](https://crt.sh) can be used to search certificates for current and historic subdomains.
- [ctsearch](https:/ui.ctsearch.entrust.com/ui/ctsearchui) is another site for searching certificates.

# Brute forcing
You can use a wordlist of common subdomains to brute force the existing ones on a domain of your choice. This can be done by sending requests with the custom domains and seeing which ones succeed.

The GitHub tool [Sublist3r](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r) can help in this.
