Vulnerabilities are usually caused by either misconfigurations or poor programming practices. It is important that administrators find these vulnerabilities before attackers do, as it can cause major issues for any organization.

Vulnerability research is the process of analyzing protocols, services, and configurations to discover the vulnerabilities and design flaws that could expose a system and its applications to exploitation, attacks, or abuse. Vulnerability research is used:
- To gather information about security trends, new threats, attack surfaces, attack vectors, and techniques
- To find weaknesses in the system and applications as well as alert the network administrator before a network attack
- To understand information that helps prevent security problems
- To know how to recover from a network attack

Ethical hackers need to keep up with the most recently discovered vulnerabilities and exploits to stay one step ahead of attackers through vulnerability research, which includes:
- Discovering the system design faults and weaknesses that might allow attackers to compromise a system
- Staying updated about new products and technologies and reading news related to current exploits
- Checking hacking sites for newly discovered vulnerabilities and exploits
- Checking newly released alerts regarding relevant innovations and product improvements for security systems
