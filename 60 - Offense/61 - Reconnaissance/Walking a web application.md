Walking a web application is the process of manually reviewing it to find security issues, for testing purposes or otherwise.

# Exploring the website
The first step is just exploring the website as it is. This means exploring the pages, clicking links, and just testing what regular users will come into contact with.

It may help to make a list of all of the pages within the website such as the home page, login page, contact page, and so on.

# Viewing the page source
Right clicking and pressing "inspect element" (or something similar) will give you access to the website's raw information. This may include links, assets, and more.

### Debugger
Inside the developer options, the debugger is intended to be used for debugging a website's JavaScript. You can add break points to the page to stop at while it loads.

### Network
The network tab keeps track of every external request that a webpage makes.

# Content discovery
### Robots.txt
Some websites have a subpage called robots.txt that lists what pages search engines are and are not allowed to index. This can be used to find hidden pages.

### Sitemap.xml
sitemap.xml gives a list of every file the website wishes to list on a search engine.
