Denial of service, a type of attack that sends a target system a flood of data or requests that consume the target system's resources. Alternatively, some applications and operating systems crash when they receive specific strings of improperly formatted data, which can be used to take down a system. The attack often uses a spoofed IP address to conceal their identity.

It is different than a DDoS attack.

The two types of DoS attacks are as follows:

# Reflective
A third party system is used to help carry out the attack. Often, the third party is not compromised, making the reflective attack difficult to track down.

# Amplified
A DNS server is usually used in this, but other services could be used too. In an amplified DoS attack, legitimate servers are tricked into flooding responses at a target system. The forged requests are small but there are many of them at once. It can be difficult to mitigate because the server involved (called the reflector server) is a legitimate device.
