A replay attack is a type of [[Man-in-the-middle|MITM/on-path]] attack where the attacker intercepts data transmissions, specifically those with authentication credentials or encryption key exchanges, then delays or resends them.

This allows attackers to disrupt communications, gain unauthorized access, or both. For example, an attacker can capture authentication traffic with tcpdump, then resend it with tcpreplay.
