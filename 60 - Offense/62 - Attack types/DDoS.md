Distributed denial-of-service attack is a type of [[DoS|DoS]] attack used to increase the amount of traffic flooded to a target system. It is a coordinated attack in which an attacker compromises multiple systems and then instructs those compromised systems, called zombies or bots, to simultaneously launch a DDoS attack against a target system. The attack uses command and control software to instruct the bots.

A DDoS attack can be recognized with a significant traffic spike.

Unlike a DoS attack, a DDoS attack originates from multiple systems at once.
