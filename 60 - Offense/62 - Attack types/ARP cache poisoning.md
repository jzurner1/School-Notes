ARP poisoning is a type of attack where spoofed ARP messages are used to alter the ARP ccache of a target host or switch, associating a given IP address with a physical device of the attacker's choice. ARP poisoning only works on local network segments.

Like other [[Redirection|redirection]] attacks, this can be used to eavesdrop, modify data in transit, or block network traffic entirely.
