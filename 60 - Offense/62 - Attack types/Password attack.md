Password attacks are one of the oldest types of attack. With it, an attacker seeks to gain access to systems or files by acquiring the actual password. There are many different types of password attacks:

# Brute-force
In this type of attack, an attacker tries all possible combinations until a match is made, such as running through all letters, numbers, characters, and password lengths until a match is found. This can be prevented by using a longer password.

# Dictionary
In this type of attack, an attacker assembles a list of relevant words and uses them to create a wordlist, which in term is plugged into the password until one it found. For example, if the target graduated from UMD in 2020, the relevant words might include UMD, terrapins, 2020, goterps, and so on.
