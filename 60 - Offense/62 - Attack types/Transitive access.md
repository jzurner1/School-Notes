Transitive access occurs when an attacker has the ability to gain access to a network or system indirectly, usually by exploiting vulnerabilities in intermediate systems or devices.

For example, an attacker may want access to an organization's internal network. This could be done by sending a phishing email to an employee and consequently compromising that employee's device. This could give the attacker transitive access, where the employee's device is the intermediate system.
