A rogue access point is a type of attack that uses an access point that legitimate users can connect to. A malicious user will then use a packet sniffer such as Wireshark to eavesdrop on communications flowing through the rogue AP.

In addition, the malicious user could configure the AP with the same SSID as one used by a legitimate AP. This is called an evil twin.
