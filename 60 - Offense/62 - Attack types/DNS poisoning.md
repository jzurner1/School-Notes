A type of attack in which an attacker injects false entries into the DNS system. This might be used to deny service to systems or to redirect them to websites that may be designed to disseminate malware or collect credentials. DNS poisoning is a type of [[Redirection|redirection]] attack.

For example, a poisoned DNS cache might redirect requests for a popular page to instead go to a malicious site.
