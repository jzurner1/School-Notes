Attackers, usually hackers, are people that attack a computer, meaning they attempt to make a computer do something it wasn't designed to do, such as breaking into a network.

# Types
- **Unauthorized (black hat)**: Criminal hackers who break computer security for personal gain or other malicious purposes. They are the type to steal or destroy information, spread malware, or otherwise damage assets.
- **Authorized (white hat)**: Security experts who study and practice haching, but only use it for legal purposes such as finding countermeasures against other hackers. These "ethical hackers" often find employment finding vulnebilities or performing penetration tests.
- **Semi-authorized (grey hat)**: Hackers that are neither malicious nor authorized. They include people who research security flaws as a recreational exercise, those who break into systems without permission but do no intentional harm, and those who  simultaneously believe their motivation is to improve the state of computer security and also don't care if their activities violate the law. This type of hacker is technically criminal, but isn't a serious threat.

# Attacker qualities
It is important to know the goals of an attacker so you can judge how much of a threat they pose to you or your organization.

- **Intent/motivation**: Attackers may be motivated by any number of reasons. Some are after specific resources or information, others will take whatever they can find, and other just want to deny service or destroy information. Their underlying motivations may be personal, financial, or political.
- **Sophistication/capability level**: Some attackers are relatively inexperienced, relying on automated tools or simple vulnerabilities. Others use much more subtle or personalized methods that can threaten even a secure organization or discover zero-day attacks that existing defenses cannot protect against.
- **Resources/funding**: Lone hackers may be threatening, but groups with lots of time, money, and people are often more threatening.
- **Location**: Some attaacks require physical proximity to your computing resources, while others can be conducted from anywhere in the world. In both cases, there's a difference between **outside attackers** who much first overcome your organization's external defenses, and **inside attackers** who already have at least some legitimate access. These are harder to defend against.
- **Target information**: Some attackers might know little about your organization and just probe at random network addresses until they find something. Others, especially inside attackers, might have knowledge about assets or vulnerabilities that help to mount successful attacks.

# Attacker types
There are many motivations and goals of attackers, but they usually fit into at least one category.

- **Script kiddies**: Unskilled hackers who rely on commonly available attack tools (such as malicious scripts) to deface websites, spread malware, or interrupt services.
- **Hacktivists**: Hackers who attack organizations to further a political or ideological message. Some represent political, religious, or economic ideologies that aren't inherently computer-related, and target perceived enemies of those groups. Some hacktivists are known as **cyberterrorists**, especially if their methods cause significant damage or disruptions.
- **Criminal syndicates**: Criminal hackers seeking financial gain who work as part of a larger organization. They might be connected to other organized crime or focused entirely on hacking.
- **Competitors**: Unethical businesses frequently attempt attacks on competitors to commit industrial espionage or to sabotage valuable resources.
- **Insiders**: Many attackers are caused by employees or former employees who have retained network access. This also includes people with knowledge of, and access to, the network.
- **Nation-states**: Nations usually have some form of intelligence agencies and dedicated cyber warfare organizations to attack or defend against rival governments, businesses, political organizations, or anyone else they perceive to be a threat to their national interests.
- **APT**: An [[APT|advanced persistent threat (APT)]] is an ongoing series of sophisticated attacks against a particular organizations. They tend to target organizations with high-value data and use long-term strategies of stealthy attacks from multiple angles, changing over time to adapt to evolving defenses.
- **Shadow IT**: Many organizations have IT resources that are not managed by the IT department, including computers, software, and online services. In many cases, IT departments don't even know they exist. This isn't an attack, but it is an active threat.
