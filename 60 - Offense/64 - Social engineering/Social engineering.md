Social engineering is a type of attack that involves taking advantage of human behavior to steal information, bypass security measures, or compromise systems.

# Principles
There are a number of principles that social engineers use to manipulate people. Any given attack can use any number of these.
- **Authority**: People tend to hand over information if they believe the attacker is a legitimate authority, even if company policy restricts it.
- **Intimidation**: Often used in conjunction with authority, this is the practice of attempting to scare the victim into compliance.
- **Consensus**: If other people think a scam is legit, the victim is more likely to think so too. The same works with mass doubting.
- **Scarcity**: The attacker plays on the victim's fear of missing out on something good such as a special bargain in an attempt to push them to make a rash decision.
- **Familiarity**: People are more likely to have their guard down around people they know and like. A social engineer may become friends with an employee to gain their trust and answer questions.
- **Trust**: Some people assume a statement is true unless given a clear reason to doubt. The phrase "I'm in IT" can get you in most offices.
- **Urgency**: A sense of urgency to make the victim comply without thinking things through, such as pushing for files for a "presentation".

# Tactics
### Impersonation
Impersonation is a very powerful technique, especially in larger organizations or those with frequent guests and visitors. In places with little security, someone with the right clothes, a purposeful stride, and an ID badge will be assumed to belong there.

Impersonation is especially dangerous over the phone where it is harder to verify someone's identity or read their body language. Help desk workers and other customer-facing employees are especially vulnerable because they are trained to be helpful.

### Pretexting
Pretexting is the art of designing a fictional scenario, or pretext, to go along with an initial claim. The cover story gives reasons for the victim to believe while keeping the attacker from stumbling over easy questions. The simpler, the better.

Some basic pretext information may be a name and contact information as well as information on what you're doing. It is important to do prior research to make it believable.

### Eliciting information
Social engineering attacks are often about extracting information from target employees, whether as a primary goal or as recon for a future attack.

Social engineers often use **interview and interrogation** techniques, where an interview is a relaxed process where the interviewer mostly listens while the subject leads the conversation and where an interrogation is where the interrogator leads the conversation, looking for some kind of specific information.

A more discreet option is **elicitation**, where the subject is lured into believing that it's a casual conversation and not an attempt to gather secret information. This can begin with various approaches but it's often based on deceit and impersonation. Skilled attackers set up meetings and conversations that "naturally" lead to the knowledge that they want. Often attackers can pretend to be ignorant or have false information so the target feels smarter by correcting the error.

# Social engineering attack types
- **Phishing**: Involves sending a fraudulent message over the internet, usually over email, attempting to make the victim hand over information.
- **URL hijacking**: In general, this is anything with misleading URLs.
- **Physical intrusion**: Attacks such as shoulder surfing, tailgating, and dumpster diving that are carried out in the real world.
