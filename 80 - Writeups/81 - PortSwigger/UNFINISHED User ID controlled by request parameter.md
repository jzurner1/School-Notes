# Description
This lab has a horizontal privilege escalation vulnerability on the user account page. To solve the lab, obtain the API key for the user `carlos` and submit it as the solution. You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

# Process
Seeing that the description described a horizontal privilege escalation vulnerability, I assumed that I would be able to identify my user with a user ID and manipulate it to view other users.

First, I logged in to my account. This listed my username and my API key, as well as the option to update my email address.
