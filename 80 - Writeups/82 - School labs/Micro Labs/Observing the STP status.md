# Description
In this lab, you will learn to observe the STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) status. Cisco Catalyst switches give us three options to configure on the `spanning-tree mode` command, which tells the switch which type of STP to use. Note that the switches do not support STP or RSTP with the single tree (CST).

# Process
1. Type `en` to enter enable mode
2. Type `conf t` to configure terminal
3. Type `spanning-tree mode ?` but don't press enter
4. Observe the various STP modes
