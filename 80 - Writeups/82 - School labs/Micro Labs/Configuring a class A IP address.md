# Description
In this lab, you will learn to configure a Class A IP address. An IP address is an address given to a computer to identify a computer or device on the Internet. A Class A IP address is an IP address in which the first bit of the octet is set to zero, which provides values from 1 to 127. By contrast, a Class B address has the first bit set to one, and the second bit set to zero to utilize the remaining address set.
