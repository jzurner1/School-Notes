A remote access policy is a policy that applies to remote connection to an organization, such as reading or sending email and viewing intranet web resources. It also usually includes every remote access oprtion including dial-up, VPNs, and web portal access.

# Important considerations
The scope of the policy should be clear and may include applicable targets such as employees, contractors, vendors, and agents with organization-owned or personally owned computers or workstations to connect to the corporate network.

It is important to clearly detail the requirements of the policy, which may include encryption and security standards as well as the acceptable areas of network access.

It might include a section on compliance, which could include exceptions to the policy, how to measure compliance, and the consequences of noncompliance.

It may also include a section that indicates what other security policies for the network closely relate to this policy.
