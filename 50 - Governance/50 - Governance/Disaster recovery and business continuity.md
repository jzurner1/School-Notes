Two separate documentation policies within a business called a disaster recovery plan (DRP) and a business continuity plan (BCP) so that, in the event of any downtime, the organization can be back up and running.

- Disaster recovery - Focuses on getting critical applications back online
- Business continuity - focuses on the tasks carried out by an organization to ensure that critical business functions continue to operate during and after a distaster

Both plans should include training, identification, and roles of the first responders as well as practice drills to confirm that the plans are functional.

An organization without these plans could fall victim to a permanent DoS attack, which could ultimated destroy the business if an attacker has damaged the hardware.
