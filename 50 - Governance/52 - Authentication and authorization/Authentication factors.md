[[Authentication|Authentication]] factors are elements that can prove an identity. There are three primary factors:
- **Something you know**, like a password, PIN, or answer to a question
- **Something you have**, like a physical key, ID badge, or smart card. This also includes any form of digital data that you can't be expected to remember like an RSA key
- **Something you are**, specifically a unique physical or behavioral characteristic such as a fingerprint, voiceprint, or signature. This includes biometrics

As technology improves, more factors can be used:
- **Somewhere you are**, such as a GPS location or having an IP address for a specific country
- **Something you do**, a form of something you are that includes behaviors such as a typing pattern
- **Something you exhibit**, more inherent behaviors such as personality traits or even detectable neurological activities
- **Someone you know**, connections to another person who is trusted
