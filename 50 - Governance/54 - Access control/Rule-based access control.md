Rule-based access control (RBAC) is a type of [[Access control|access control]] where access is determined by a set of rules configured by administrators; these can be either static or dynamic and may be triggered by other events. It is used to describe multiple, mutually exclusive approaches to access control. Some are more sophisticated than others. The most common application of this model is that in routers and firewalls, which use rules to allow or deny traffic.
