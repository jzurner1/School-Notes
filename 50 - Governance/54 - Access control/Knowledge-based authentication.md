Knowledge-based authentication (KBA) is a way to provide [[Identity proofing|identity proofing]].

- **Static KBA** uses pre-arranged questions such as security questions. It is common but easy to bypass so it is not recommended.

- **Out-of-band proofing** is an OOW method using a second communications channel to provide [[Defense in depth|defense in depth]], such as requiring phone verification in addition to online verification.
