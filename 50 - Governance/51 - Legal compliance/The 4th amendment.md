The 4th amendment protects people from unauthorized search and seizure without a warrant or special exception. A warrant must have probably cause, be issued by a neutral and detached magistrate, and described with particularity. An exception applies with voluntary consent from an individual, plain view, probable cause in a vehicle, and so on.

Evidence obtained from unauthorized search and seizure falls into the exclusionary rule, where evidence that is illegally obtained cannot be used against the person whose rights were violated.
