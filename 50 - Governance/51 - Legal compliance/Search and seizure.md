Search and seizure is the process of some authority's examination of a person's home, vehicle, or business to find evidence that a crime has been committed. A search involves going through that individual's property and looking for specific items that are related to a crime that they have reason to believe has been committed. A seizure occurs if the officers take possession of items during the search.
