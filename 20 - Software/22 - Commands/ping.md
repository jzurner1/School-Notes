A command used to check IP connectivity between two network devices.

It uses ICMP, so when you send a ping command, your PC sends an ICMP echo message to a specified host. If the destination host is reachable, they will respond with an ICMP echo reply message. Alternatively, the default gateway will send it back to your PC, indicating that either the host was unreachable, an ICMP echo timed out, or the time-to-live value reached zero.
