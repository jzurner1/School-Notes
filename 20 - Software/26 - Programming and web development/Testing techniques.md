When an application is developed, it must be tested to see if it meets the requirements set for it. There are several tests that must be done to ensure that it meets the objectives.

### Vulnerability testing
The goal of this is to locate vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. This can be done with vulnerability scanners, which run through the application with a defined set of parameters and security threats to determine if the application is vulnerable.

This type of testing is recommended for all types of applications and systems before they are made live. This is usually an automated process designed to find as many vulnerabilities as possible before penetration testing takes place.

### Penetration testing
Penetration testing is more focused than vulnerability testing. Penetration testers attempt to look for vulnerabilities and then go as far as they can into the application.

### Performance testing
This is used to determine the performance of an application or a system with a certain workload to determine the performance of the application or system with different workloads.

### Load testing
This is the process of assessing the capacity of your cloud systems and applications to perform in a high production scenario. A real-world load is simulated and placed on the systems and applications to evaluate how each one performs.

### Regression testing
This type of testing is used to see the impact of new or modified code in an application that has been altered.

### Functional testing
Functional testing ensure that the systems that are being created actually solve the problem(s) they were created to solve. This may be done by an individual that has never used the application before and has no knowledge of it.

### Usability testing
This determines if the application is easy to use by the users. You select a set of users and ask them to use the application.
