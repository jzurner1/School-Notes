[[Web application|Web applications]] have various levels that include a number of technologies. This introduces a variety of potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

- **Layer 7** - Includes the web application itself, and therefore includes all the vulnerabilities that come with it. This can include things like [[XSS|XSS]] or [[Injection attacks|injection attacks]], which may go on to affect the database layer (layer 4).
- **Layer 6** - Third-party components, such as services that integrate with the website to achieve certain functionality. For example, a website may use another external site for payments.
- **Layer 5** - The web server can include many vulnerabilities itself. This can include things like inadvertently advertising service versions, which could allow attackers to research vulnerabilities.
- **Layer 4** - The database stores sensitive user information such as user IDs, passwords, phone numbers, and more. These could be released in the event of a database breach, such as with SQL injection.
- **Layer 3** - Operating systems can have open ports, which may allow attackers to gain access to a system.
- **Layer 2** - Routers and switches route network traffic to specific machines. This could be altered or disabled with attacks like [[MAC flooding|MAC flooding]].
- **Layer 1** - [[IPS|IPS]] and [[IDS|IDS]] can be used to detect if any malicious traffic enters a network. Attackers may be able to find a way to avoid detection.
