An environment is a particular configuration of hardware and software designed to be ideal for a particular process.

# Environment types
Different types of environments are used for different processes.

### Development environment
A development environment is a type of environment in which software developers develop an application.

### Quality assurance environment
After an application is developed or modified, it is sent to the quality assurance team. This team tests the code to detect any issues such as bugs or impacts on the existing code.

### Staging environment
This is a replica of the production environment, which hosts the live application. This environment is made to ensure that the application behaves as expected.

### Production environment
This is where the application is deployed to users.

### Blue-green environment
A blue-green deployment consists of the production environment and the staging environment, where either one can be labeled as blue or green. It is used to test deployments and switch environments when an application is updated to limit downtime.
