A database management system (DBMS) is a software system used to store, retrieve, and run queries on data. It serves as an interface between an end-user and a database, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data in the database.

## Types
The four major types of DBMS are:
- **Relational** - A system where data is stored in two-dimensional tables using rows and columns. This is the most common type and includes Oracle Database and MySQL.
- **Object-oriented** - A system where information or data is represented in the form of objects, which can be used in object-oriented programming. These require less code and are easier to maintain, but aren't as common. The most common example is Object DB.
- **Hierarchical** - A system where data elements have parents and children, in a tree-like structure. This includes IMS (by IBM) and the Windows Registry.
- **Network** - A system where the data elements maintain a network-like relationship. It has a hierarchical structure, but data is organized like a graph.
