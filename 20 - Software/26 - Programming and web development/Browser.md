A browser is a type of software used to view websites.

Typically, when a webpage is loaded, the browser will make requests for the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for that page. The browser takes those pieces of code and runs them inside an execution environment, which is the browser tab.

The execution environments are effectively buckets; each browser tab has one. The code in each environment is run entirely separately and cannot influence code on other environments or websites.
