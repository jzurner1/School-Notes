The Linux boot process is similar to other boot processes, but there are a few more details.

There are three main steps:
1. The device's firmware starts, performs a quick POST test, and then looks for a bootloader program to run from a bootable device.
2. The bootloader runs and determines what Linux kernel program to load.
3. The kernel program loads into memory and starts the necessary background programs required for the system to operate (such as a GUI for desktops).

# Overview
When the system boots, most Linux distributions will display the process in messages on the screen. If not, you can press `ctrl+alt+f1` or the `esc` key to view them.

When the system is running, you can view the most recent boot time messages using the `dmesg` command. THese messages are stored in the **kernel ring buffer**, which is circular and rotates out older messages as newer ones are rotated in.

Most distributions also store the boot messages in a log file, usually in the `/var/log` folder. For Debian-based systems it is usually `/var/log/boot` and for Red Hat-based systems it is usually `/var/log/boot.log`.
