This page is for how commands work and their syntax; for a list of commands, see [[Linux command list|this page]].

# Some notes
- **Running multiple commands**: You can run multiple commands by separating them with a semicolon. For example, you could do `pwd; ls`. This works both in the terminal and in scripts.
- **Redirecting output**: You can change how output is processed in a number of ways, specifically with the `>`, `>>`, and `|` symbols. See [[Linux data streams|this page]] for more information.
- **Scripting**: [[Shell scripting|Shell scripting]] is the main type of scripting in Linux. It works by successively executing a list of commands and it supports variables and logic.
