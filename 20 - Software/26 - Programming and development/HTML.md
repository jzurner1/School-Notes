Hypertext markup language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.

# HTML elements
An HTML element is defined by a start tag and an end tag, usually with some content inside of it. Common types include headings (`<h1></h1>`), paragraphs (`<p></p>`), and so on.

The `<html></html>` element is the root element and defines the whole HTML document. Inside of that is usually a `<body></body>` element.
