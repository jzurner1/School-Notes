When BIOS/UEFI needs new features, it can be upgraded. This term is known as flashing the BIOS or updating the firmware. There are a number of reasons that an upgrade may be needed:
- Provide support for new or upgraded hardware such as a processor or a faster USB port
- Provide support for a higher-capacity hard drive
- Increased virus protection
- Solve problems with current versions, such as a security patch
- Reduce the time it takes the computer to boot

Viruses can infect the BIOS/UEFI so it should be write-protected unless an update is needed.
