The basic input/output system (BIOS) is an important motherboard component. It is also known as the unified extensible firmware interface (UEFI), EFI, BIOS/UEFI, or UEFI/BIOS.

It has a number of functions:
- Holds and executes power-on self-test (POST), which is a program that identifies, tests, and initializes basic hardware components
- Holds a basic routine called a bootstrap program that locates an OS and launches it, allowing the OS to then control the system
- Holds Setup, a program that allows viewing and managing settings related to the display, date/time, processor, memory, and drives. Other names include BIOS setup, system setup, and CMOS setup
- Turns over control to an adapter's onboard BIOS so that the car can initialize during the computer boot process


# POST
The POST test mentioned above performs basic tests of individual hardware components such as the motherboard, RAM, keyboard, optical drive, and hard drive. When a computer is turned on, BIOS executes post. An indication that POST is running is that the indicator lights on devices may flash. BIOS can be configured to reduce the time and number of devices checked by POST.


# UEFI
UEFI is the interfeace between the operating system and the firmware. It can be traditional BIOS or UEFI can replace the BIOS. Unlike BIOS, UEFI can do a lot of small tasks such as running a virus scan, using a GUI, executing utilities, performing a backup or restore, and so on, depending on the manufacturer.

Many manufacturers have switched to UEFI BIOS for a few reasons:
- GUI that has mouse support
- Offers more BIOS-based software that is not just configuration screens
- Offers better support for cooling, voltage levels, performance, and security.
- Visible monitoring data
