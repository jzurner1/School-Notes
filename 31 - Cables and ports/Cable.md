An insulated wire or wires with a protective casing used for transmitting electricity or telecommunication signals. It is a form of [[Hardware|Hardware]].

# Specifications and limitations
Networks generally have requirements for a connection, and the proper cable must be used. It is important to focus on at least these three aspects of the media:

- **Throughtput**: The measure of the total amount of data that the media can send over a given time period
- **Speed**: The measure of the data send rate
- **Distance**: With both wired and wireless media, the further away the sender is from the receiver, the more side effects will be encountered. That's why all cables have a maximum distance

# Considerations
Besides the specifications and limitations, there are a few other considerations for a cable:

- **Shielded versus unshielded**: Shielded cable does not suffer from EMI, but costs much more money
- **Plenum**: Whether or not the cable will release toxic fumes when burning

# Common issues
- **Attenuation**: An effect of long distances with cable, specifically how much it weakens in decibels (dB)
- **Interference**: EMI and other things that can alter the data
- **Decibel loss**: Caused by lots of splits or splices
