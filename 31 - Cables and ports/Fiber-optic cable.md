An alternative to copper cabling, fiber-optic [[Cable|cables]] send light instead of electricity through an optical fiber that is usually made of glass. This makes the cables immune to EMI and, depending on the layer 1 technology used, may have a greater range and data-carrying capacity. Fiber optics often uses lasers but may also use LEDs.

There are two main types of fiber-optic cables, multimode and single-mode. Multimode fiber is built to keep refractions in a contained area while single-mode prevents refractions from occuring at all. Single-mode is more expensive but allows for a longer distance.
