# Troubleshooting
The first step in troubleshooting is always to check the cabling and the power. Make sure the configuration is correct and the devices are receiving the right amount of power.

Next, restart the computer. If a device is drawing more power than is allowed, the computer can disable the port. This can only be changed through a restart.

Does the device need a driver that you don't have installed? Check in the device manager.
