IEEE 802.1X is an approach to WLAN security. It requires all wireless users to authenticate using credentials such as a username and password, which prevents the compromising of one password to jeopardize the entire WLAN.

IEEE 802.1X is a technology that allows wireless clients to authenticate with an authentication server, typically a remote authentication dial-in user service (RADIUS) server.

It defines the encapsulation of EAP over wired networks.
