WPA is a standard for WLAN security. It was originally created to address the weaknesses in WEP. It includes a number of security enhancements:

- WPA operating in enterprise mode can require a user to be authenticated before keys are exchanged
- In enterprise mode, the keys used are temporary session keys
- WPA uses temportal key integrity protocol (TKIP) for enhanced encryption. While it does rely on an initialization vector (IV), it is 48 bits. It also rotates keys occasionally. TKIP uses RC4 for encryption.
- TKIP leverages message integrity check (MIC), also known as message integrity code, to confirm that data has not been modified in transit

WPA is technically WPA1, or WPA version 1. It has mostly been replaced by WPA2.
