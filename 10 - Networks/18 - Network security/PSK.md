A preshared key is an approach to WLAN security that is used to encrypt transmission between a wireless client and an access point. The PSK is used to encrypt traffic, possibly using an algorithm, such that any intercepted traffic would be unusable without knowing the PSK. It can be effective for small networks but isn't too practical for a larger network.

WLAN security based on PSK technology is called Personal Mode.
