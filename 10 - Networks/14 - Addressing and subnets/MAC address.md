A 48-bit address assigned to a device's network interface card (NIC). They are written in hexadecimal notation where the first 24 bits are the vendor code and the last 24 bits are assigned by the manufacturer as a serial number for the device. They are unique worldwide.

There are many other names for MAC addresses, including [[Ethernet data-link protocol#Addressing|Ethernet addresses]], LAN addresses, and NIC addresses.

MAC addresses represent a single NIC or other Ethernet port, so they can be called unicast Ethernet addresses. This is in comparison to broadcast addresses (which refer to all devices currently on the LAN) and multicast addresses (which refer to some subset of all the devices currently on the LAN).
