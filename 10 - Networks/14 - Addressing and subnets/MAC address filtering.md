MAC address filtering is an approach to WLAN security. In MAC address filtering, an access point is configured with a list of MAC addresses that are permitted to associate with the AP. Any devices that don't have a trusted MAC address are denied.

While this is very effective, it also requires a lot of work to keep the list updated. In addition, MAC spoofing can get around the filter.
