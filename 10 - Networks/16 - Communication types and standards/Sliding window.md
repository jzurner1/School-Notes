A technique for controlling transmitted data packets between two network nodes when using the transport layer of the OSI model or TCP.

This technique places varying limits on the number of data packets that are sent before waiting a set amount of time for an acknowledgement signal. The number of data packets is called the window sze and it depends on the rate at which the receiving computer can process the data packets and the capacity of its buffer.
