Multiplexing allows multiple communication sessions to share the same physical media. For example, cable TV allows you to receive multiple channels over a single physical medium. There are multiple approaches:

#### Time-division multiplexing (TDM)
TDM supports different communication sessions such as different telephone conversations on a single network. It works by allowing each session a turn in sending data during a time slot. First one session is sent, then another, and so on until all sessions have sent their data before it repeats.

#### Statistical time-division multiplexing (StatTDM)
TDM gives all communication sessions an equal time slot, even if they have no data to send. StatTDM dynamically assigned time slots instead to make it more of an as-needed basis.

#### Frequency-division multiplexing (FDM)
FDM divides a medium's frequency range into channels. Different communications sessions send their data over different channels. As previously mentioned, this approach to bandwidth usage is called broadband.

#### Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)
OFDM encodes digital data onto multiple carrier frequencies. It is very popular today and is used in wideband digital communications. It is useful for applications such as digital television, audio broadcasting, DSL internet access, wireless networks, powerline networks, and 4G/5G mobile communications.
