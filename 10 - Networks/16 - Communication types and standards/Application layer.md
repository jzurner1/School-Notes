The seventh layer of the [[OSI Model|OSI Model]]. The application layer gives application services to a network. This layer supports services used by end user such as Microsoft Word. It is important to note that these services do not live at this layer.

For example, email is an application service that exists at the application layer but Microsoft Outlook does not live at this layer.

# Application services
Application services are services that exist at the application layer. It includes a number of protocols such as STMP (simple mail transfer protocol) for email and HTTP (hyper text transfer protocol) for web browsers.

# Service advertisement
Some application services such as networked printers periodically send out advertisements to make their availability known to other devices on the network. Other services such as Microsoft Active Directory must be queried by other devices seeking those services.
