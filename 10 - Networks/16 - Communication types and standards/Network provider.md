A network provider is a way that internet (or another network) is provided to a location.

# Satellite
Used mostly for rural locations, satellites can provide WAN connectivity. The two major considerations for this method are delay and weather sensitivity.

# Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
An older and more rare provider method, DSL uses a group of technologies that provide data transmission over telephone wiring.

# Cable modem
Cable television companies use coaxial and/or fiber-optic cabling for data transmission.

# Leased line
Also known as a dedicated leased line, a leased line is a point-to-point connection between two sites. All the bandwidth on that line is available to those sites and does not need to be shared among multiple service provider customers.
