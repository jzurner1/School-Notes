DIal-up is a type of internet connection that uses a modem to connect to a phone line. It is called dial-up because the modem uses the traditional phone line to "dial up"/call another modem.

The modem converts a signal transmitted over the phone line to digital 1's and 0's that can be read by the computer. It also does the opposite, modulating 1's and 0's so they can be sent over a phone line.
