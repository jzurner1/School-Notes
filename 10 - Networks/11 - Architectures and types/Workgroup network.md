Unlike a server-based network, a workgroup network does not have a centralized server and usually has a smaller number of devices.

Each computer acts as its own server and resources are shared between them all. This is known as a client/server relationship where, when they communicate, one device acts as a server and allows information to be obtained by the client (another device). Another name for any network that allows sharing of resources on a small network is a peer-to-peer network.

This type of network is generally cheaper than a server-based network, but it is also not as secure. Each computer must be configured with individual user IDs and passwords, and each device has more permissions.

In the example workgroup network above, workstation 2 has a shared printer and a WORDDOCS folder, both available for everyone to use. The issue is that each item would require the person to know the associated password, in this case Tech2001 and Stealth2, respectively.

# HomeGroup
If the network above was converted to a HomeGroup, the HomeGroup would share a single password. Any devices accessing any of the shared resources would need that one password. This is easier to manage because users do not need to know other users' passwords.
