As files are added to a [[Hard drive|Hard drive]] over time, they become fragmented, meaning that the clusters that make up a file are not adjacent to each other. This slows down the hard drive because the FAT has to keep track of the scattered clusters and the hard drive read/write head assembly must move to different locations on the drive's surface to access a single file.

Defragmentation is the practice of placing files in contiguous sectors, as seen above. Defragmentation should not be done to SSDs.
