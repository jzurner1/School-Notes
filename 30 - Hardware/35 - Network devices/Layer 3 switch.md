While a [[Layer 2 switch|Layer 2 switch]] makes forwarding decisions based on MAC address information, a layer 3 switch (also known as a multilayer switch or a layer 3 capable switch) can make decisions based on upper-layer information. It is a [[Network device|networking device]].

For example, a multilayer switch could function as a router and make forwarding decisions based on destination IP address information. It can also use other upper-layer information such as port numbers in decisions.

Multilayer ports can also be used to interconnect not just network segments but entire networks. For traffic to travel between two different networks, the traffic must be routed, where a forwarding decision is based on layer 3 information.

A multilayer switch can be the boundary of a broadcast domain.
