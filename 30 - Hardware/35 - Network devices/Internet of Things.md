"An IoT device or object, in short, is an embedded computer device. Because IoT devices are connected among themselves and with human operators, they can share information and make dynamic decisions on their own (autonomous) or assist humans to make the decision. This Internet connectivity allows more integrated, symbiotic decision making better than uncoordinated decision making by individual devices/objects."

There are a couple main issues with IoT:
- Pervasiveness and scale of monstrous proportions
	- By definition, IoT can be anything. There are about 18 billion devices in the IoT in 2022
- Safety, security and privacy
	- There are so many different IoT devices that many of them certainly have large vulnerabilities that haven't been discovered yet
