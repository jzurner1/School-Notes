A load balancer is a [[Network device|Network device]] that handles the task of load balancing, meaning it can assist with performance and high availability of key network devices and services.

For example, a load balancer can sit in front of a group of web servers at a datacenter and ensure that requests are intelligently distributed to the servers. Often this distribution is based on the resources available for each web server. It will also check the health of the nodes periodically and intelligently prevent the forwarding of requests to a server that isn't working correctly.
