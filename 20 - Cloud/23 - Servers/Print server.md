Having a printer for every office is often a waste of money in a business environment. The ability to share network printers has become common in most offices and some home environments too.

# CUPS
The standard Linux print sharing software package is called the common Unix printing system (CUPS), which allows a Linux system to connect to any printer resource, either locally or via a network, by using a common application interface that operates over dedicated printer drivers.

The CUPS system also allows you to share a locally attached printer with other Linux systems. This allows you to connect a printer to a Linux server and share it among multiple users in a network.
