A big issue with application developers is creating an environment that mirrors the actual server environment. The best way to do this is with a container.

A container is a self-contained environment to encapsulate applications. A container package has all of the necessary application files, library files, and operating system libraries in a bundle that can easily be moved between environments.

There are several Linux packages that support containers. The most common are currently Docker and Kubernetes, which can both be used to easily port application containers to any Linux server.
