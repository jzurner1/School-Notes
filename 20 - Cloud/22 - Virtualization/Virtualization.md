Virtualization is the act of creating a virtual version of something at the same abstraction layer. It is very important for networks and used for technologies such as virtual servers and virtual desktops.

There are two major forms of virtualization solutions, on-site and off-site. On-site virtualization is on servers that physically exist at the company's location while off-site is hosted somewhere else, such as on the cloud.
