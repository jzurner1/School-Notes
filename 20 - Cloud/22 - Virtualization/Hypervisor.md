A hypervisor is a type of software used in the creation of virtual servers. It takes physical hardware and abstracts it for the virtual server. To virtual machines, the hypervisor looks like underlying hardware.

# Type 1
A type 1 hypervisor is known as a native hypervisor because the operating system runs on top of the hypervisor. Examples include VMware's ESXI and Microsoft's Hyper-V.

# Type 2
A type 2 hypervisor, also known as a hosted hypervisor, runs on top of a host operating system. This includes VMware Player, Oracle Virtualbox, and Windows Virtual PC.
