A concern with the cloud, especially for public cloud providers. There are a number of major concerns such as data breaches, DoS attacks, and so on.

# Risks
- Any cloud service is still a network service and thus subject to network attacks. The risk is no different from traditional network services, but it can differ from traditional desktop applications
- Using an off-premises cloud service requires an internet connection with all the risks and limitations that it entails. In addition to any latency or bandwidth constraints on your connection, you must ensure cloud communications are secured.
- Apart from the need for secured communications with outside providers, using a cloud service for sensitive information means giving a lot of control of its handling over to another entity. The provider may not pay the same attention to data security that your organization would, especially if your data is subject to special regulatory requirements.
- Individual cloud services have different privacy policies on how they might share customer data and information, and precisely what jurisdictional privacy laws apply.

# Common vulnerabilities
In addition to the vulnerabilities that are present in both cloud and normal deployments, cloud deployments have some unique ones that must be considered.
- APIs used for communication between cloud services
- Passwords, encryption keys, and API keys used to secure data and services
- Improper protection of cloud-based data
- Insufficient logging, monitoring, or documentation deployed resources
- Failure to adequately log cloud activities or to integrate cloud monitoring into other aspects of continuous monitoring

# Benefits
The cloud can provide a number of security benegits as well.
- **Sandboxing**: Secure sandboxing, such as for testing and development purposes, is a natural application. A cloud provider may be able to provide flexible, secure environments that you can't easily access in-house.
- **Antivirus**: Antimalware software is difficult to fully host on the cloud because of the amount of real-time monitoring of local files and network traffic, but it can augment antimalware clients by centralizing monitoring and updates or performing centralized compute-intensive tasks such as advanced heuristics.
- **Vulnerability scanning**: Cloud-based vulnerability scanners can be easier and less expensive to deploy and maintain than on-premises solutions.
- **Content filtering**: Content filtering on the cloud can save cost or labor relative to on-premise filtering, and it can scale more easily.
- **FWaaS**: Firewall-as-a-service is a next-generation firewall (NGFW) deployed on the cloud to protect cloud or on-premises services.
- **MaaS**: Monitoring-as-a-service implements monitoring solutions such as state monitoring or SIEM as an online service.
- **AaaS**: Authentication-as-a-service centralizes authentication systems on the cloud. It offloads much of the maintenance and support of an identity system onto the cloud service provider, but it might be more costly and reduce flexibility.
