# Advantages
### Trade capital expenses for variable expense
**Capital expenses** are funds that a company uses to acquire, upgrade, and maintain 
physical assets such as property, industrial buildings, or equipment. In comparison, a **variable expense** is an expense that the person who pays can easily alter or avoid.

In cloud technologies, using the cloud allows you to pay only when you consume resources and pay only for the amount you consume.

### Benefit from economies of scale
With cloud computing you can achieve a lower variable cost (costs that change as the quantity of the goods or services that are produced changes) than you can get on your own. Because hundreds of thousands of thousands of customers use AWS, AWS can achieve higher **economies of scale**, which translates into lower individual prices.

### Stop guessing capacities
With cloud computing, you don't need to guess about infrastructure capacities. You can adjust the cloud to fit your needs and scale it dynamically.

### Increase speed and agility
New resources can be as little as a click away, reducing the time it takes from weeks to minutes. This makes organizations much more efficient and thus more cost effective.

### Save money on data centers
When you stop running and maintaining data centers, you save a lot of money. This also allows you to focus on business instead of resources.

### Go global
With cloud computing, you can easily host your application in multiple regions around the world for lower latency and cost.
