The first step in making a security strategy is designing a risk assessment process to determine your security needs.

There are a few steps involved in a complete risk assessment:
1. Identify assets potentially at risk
2. Complete a threat assessment for each asset
3. Analyze the business impact of each threat
4. Determine the likelihood of a given threat doing damage
5. Prioritize risks by weighing the likelihood vs. potential impact of each threat
6. Create a risk mitigation strategy to shape future security politicies

# Risk register
Before completing any of the steps, it is a good idea to create a **risk register**, which is a formal document of the risks that have been discovered as well as what data has been gathered about them. This can be done with a spreadsheet, database, or dedicated software.

For each risk identified, the risk should have a variety of fields, with details corresponding to the process being used:
- A unique ID and description
- A category to group similar risks
- Likelihood
- Business impact
- Priority
- Mitigation steps and strategies
- Residual risk remaining after mitigation
- Contingencies if prevention isn't successful
- Who is responsible for managing the risk

# Step 1: Identify assets
An organization can have many different types of assets:
- Information and data such as customer data, intellectual property, trade secrets, and operational data like financial and security information
- Computing hardware and software
- Business inventory
- Buildings and other physical facilities
- Cash and other financial assets
- Personnel
- Branding and business reputation
- Business relationships, including partner assets

# Step 2: Threat assessment
A threat assessment is the process of considering all the bad things that could happen to each of the assets. It's not a bad idea to include wild improbabilities.
- Accidents and disasters
- Equipment failure
- Supply chain failure
- Human error and negligence
- Malicious insiders and outsiders

# Step 3: Impact analysis
Once all of the threats are listed, you need to find the potential costs and other impacts of those threats. You need to calculate both direct and indirect impact, such as the cost of replacing a server that fails as well as the value of the time it was out.

# Step 4: Threat probability
While anything can happen, some things are more likely than others. That's why it's important to analyze the probability of each threat.
- Existing event logs are valuable for predicting future tjreats
- The probability of threats such as disasters, accidents, and crimes depend on location and field of business
- Equipment manufacturers generally state expected failure rates for their equipment
- **MTTF**: Mean time to failure, the average time it takes for a newly installed device to fail. It's most accurate with components that are replaced such as hard drives.
- **MTTR**: Mean time to repair, the average time it takes to repair a serviceable device
- **MTBF**: Mean time between failures, sometimes interchangeable with MTTF. Used to describe how long you should expect a newly online service to work before failure
- **MTBSI**: Mean time between service incidents: The average time between two vailures, including the time needed for repairs. Equal to MTBF + MTTR

# Step 5: Risk measurement
There are two methods for measuring and prioritizing risks, and you should choose depending on the assets you're protecting and the threats you're protecting against:
- **Quantitative risk assessment** assigns an objective value, usually monetary, to each risk based on the probability and impact cost of the associated threat. It can give a clear cost-benefit analysis for a given security control, but its only accurate when you can determine a clear and concrete cost for each potential impact.
- **Qualitative risk assessment** also begins with the probability and impact cost of each threat, but instead of monetary values, it uses human judgement to calculate and assign a priority to the associated risk. By its nature, qualitative risk assessment is inexact and subjet to biases but it works well for assets and impacts with intangible costs.

# Step 6: Risk management strategies
In the end, you need to be able to identify risks and decide how to act on them. Some organizations have more risk tolerance than others, so it is also important to decide how much tolerance your organization has.
