It's important for organizations to have proper knowledge about various possible threat actors and their tactics. Security professionals often use indicators of compromise (IoCs) as a way to quickly detect possible threats entering the organization.

- **Email indicators**: Attackers often use email services to send malicious data to the target organization or individual. Examples of email indicators can include the sender's email address, email subject, attachments, or links within the email.
- **Network indicators**: These are useful for command and control, malware delivery, and identifying details about the operating system, browser type, and other computer-specific information. Examples include URLs, domain names, and IP addresses.
- **Host-based indicators**: These are found by performing an analysis of the infected system within the organizational network. Examples include filenames, file hashes, registry keys, DLLs, and mutex.
- **Behavior indicators**: Generally, IoCs are useful for identifying signs of intrusion. Behavioral indicators are used to identify specific behaviors related to malicious activities such as code injection into the memory or running the scripts of an application.

Here are some of the key IoCs:
- Unusual outbound traffic
- Unusual activity from a privileged account
- Gogoraphic anomalies
- Multiple login failures
- Increased database read volume
- Large HTML response size
- Multiple requests for a single file
- Mismatched port-application traffic
- Suspicious registry or system file changes
- Unusual DNS requests
- Unexpected patching of systems
- Signs of DDoS activity
- Bundles of data in the wrong places
- Web traffic with odd behavior
