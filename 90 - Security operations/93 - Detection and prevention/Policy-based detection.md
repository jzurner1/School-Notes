An approach to IPS/IDS detection, policy-based detection requires an IDS/IPS device to have a specific declaration of the security policy, for example to identify which networks are recognized. Any out-of-profile traffic could be reported. It could also identify unencrypted channels such as Telnet or HTTP and report them.
