An intrusion detection system is a passive monitoring solution for detecting threats in a network such as an intrusion. It can be deployed on a particular host, enabling it to monitor that host's network traffic, or it can be deployed at the network level, allowing it to identify threats to the entire network. It can detect threats using signature-, anomaly-, or policy-based detection.

Unlike IPS, IDS doesn't take any actions to block or remediate an identified threat.

Because traffic does not flow through the IDS device, it is considered to be passive. While it can communicate with a security device to prevent subsequent attack packets, the initial packets reach their destinations.
