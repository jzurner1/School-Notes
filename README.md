# School-Notes
This is a place for me to back up the notes I've taken over my time working towards my bachelor's degree in cybersecurity. It is a work in progress and I will try to keep it updated.

## Usage
These notes were taken in the notetaking program [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), so I recommend that you read them with that for the full experience. To do so, create a new vault and put all of these files/folders in the vault folder. If you would like to contribute or have some corrections, just toss a request in! I would appreciate it.

## Writeups
The writeups section is new, but it is where I hope to post any writeups I make from labs or similar things. I don't know the actual format for writeups, so everything I do will just be in whatever method fits best.
