The open system interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual model that provides a baselines for communication between systems. It consists of seven layers, where information moves down the layers when it leaves a device and up the layers when it enters a device.

**The software/upper layers:**
Layer 7 is the application layer, which is closest to the user. It uses data as the PDU.
Layer 6 is the presentation layer. It uses data as the PDU.
Layer 5 is the session layer. It uses data as the PDU.

**The heart of the model:**
Layer 4 is the transport layer. It uses segments/datagrams as the PDU.

**The hardware/lower layers:**
Layer 3 is the network layer. It uses packets as the PDU.
Layer 2 is the data link layer. It uses frames as the PDU.
Layer 1 is the physical layer, which is the physical medium. It uses bits as the PDU.
