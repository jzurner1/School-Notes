Bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path. It can be determined by a number of factors but most notably is the type of medium used.

The bandwidth of a network is measured in terms of how many bits the network can transmit during one second. For example, if a network can send 10,000,000 bits in a second, that bandwidth is considered to be 10 megabits.

# Bandwidth usage
There are two fundamental approaches to bandwidth usage on a network:

#### Broadband
Broadband divides the bandwidth on a medium into different channels, then a sender can transmit different communications over the various channels. This method is common with TV and cable systems.

#### Baseband
Baseband uses all the available frequencies on a medium to send data. Ethernet uses this method.
