As networks become more available to users, so too do the metrics used to monitor and assess them. Both network devices and networks themselves must be monitored to ensure peak performance. This is a part of network management

# Devices
All of the devices on a network need to be monitored individually for a few key metrics:

### Temperature
All devices have a best operating temperature range, where any temperatures above or below that range may negatively impact their performance or even damage them. This can become an issue if air flow is blocked, devices aren't installed correctly, or the environment is too hot or cold. Sensors, specifically environmental variables, are used for things like temperature, humidity, and so on.

### CPU usage
If a CPU's utilization is too high, it may indicate that the CPU or another device is failing. It may also mean that there are unwanted programs running on the network.

### Memory
To improve the performance of network devices, data is taken from nonvolatile storage (such as a hard drive) and put into volatile storage (such as RAM). It is important to have an excess of volatile memory in order to let programs use what they need to run optimally.

# Network
The network itself has metrics that need to be monitored.

### Bandwidth
Bandwidth is the measure of how much information can travel through a network path, either wired or wirelessly. Be sure to prevent bottlenecking and make sure to consider how many ports you have. For example, if you have 100 10Gbps ports, it isn't good enough to have a 20Gbps connection connecting them all.

### Latency
Latency is the delay of packets between being sent and received. It is important to take baseline measurements to understand the latency in a network. In addition, many technologies will not perform well if there is too much latency.

### Jitter
Jitter is the variation in times between packet arrivals. For example, a network with a lot of jitter may have 10ms between two packets, then 50ms for the next one, then 30ms for the next one. This is especially an issue for VoIP.
