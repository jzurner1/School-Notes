A virtual local area network is a logical subnetwork that groups together a collection of devices from different physical LANs. They are often used with larger businesses to partition a network for improved traffic management. It is supported with several kinds of physical networks such as Ethernet and WiFi.

For example, if you have a large business with different departments, you will want to put those departments into smaller subnets. This may mean having the accounting department in one subnet and the sales department in another. This can be done easily with VLANs.
