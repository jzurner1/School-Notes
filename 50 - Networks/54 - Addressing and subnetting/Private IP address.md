A private IP address, also known as a RFC 1918 address, is an IP address that is used to identify devices within your network. It is assigned by a router. It allows devices to connect to each other on the same network without exposing them directly to the internet, which is more dangerous.

The addresses range as follows:
10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
