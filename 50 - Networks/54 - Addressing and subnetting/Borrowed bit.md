A borrowed bit is a bit added to a subnet mask that changes a classful mask to a classless mask.

They can be used to calculate the number of total subnets as *subnets = 2b*, where *b* represents the number of borrowed bits. For example, if an octet has the value 192, it can be converted into 11000000 which has two borrowed bits. That means it has 2\*2 subnets, or 4 total.
