A coaxial [[cable|cable]], also known as coax, consists of two conductors. One is an inner insulated conductor surrounded by the other conductor that is usually made of  a metallic foil or woven wire.

The inner conductor is shielded by the outer conductor so the cable is resistant to EMI. Coaxial cables have an associated characteristic impedance that needs to be balanced by the device (or terminator) with which the cable connects.

There are three common forms of coaxial cable:
- RG-59: Typically used for short-distance applications such as coarrying composite video between two nearby devides. It has loss characteristics that make it not right for long-distance applications. It has a characteristic impedance of 75 ohms.
- RG-6: Used by local cable companies to connect individual homes to the cable company's distribution network. Like RG-59, it has a characteristic impedance of 75 ohms.
- RG-58: Has similar loss characteristics and distance limitations to RG-59, but it has a characteristic impedance of 50 ohms. This type of cable was populat with early 10BASE2 Ethernet networks.

There is also twinaxial cabling, called twinax, which is similar but uses two inner conductors instead of one. It is significantly less common.

# Common coaxial connectors
- BNC: A Bayonet-Neill-Concelman (BNC) connector (also known as British Naval Connector) is used for a number of applications, including as a connector in the old 10BASE2 Ethernet networks. It could be used to connect two coaxial cables back-to-back.
- F-connector: An F-connector is often used for cable TV and cable modem connections. It is also known as an F-type connector.
