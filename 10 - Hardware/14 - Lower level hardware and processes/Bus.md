A bus is any kind of connection that transfers data between components inside a computer or between computers.

# Processor
A [[CPU|processor]] bus is a high-speed internal connection within a processor. They are generally used to send control signals and data between the processor and other components.

There are three main types of buses:
- Address bus: carries memory addresses from the processor to other components such as primary memory and IO devices.
- Data bus: carries the actual data between the processor and other components.
- Control bus: carries control signals from the processor to other components. Also carries the clock's pulses.
