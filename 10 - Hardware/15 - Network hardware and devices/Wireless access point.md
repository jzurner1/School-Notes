A wireless access point is an [[access point|access point]] that allows devices to connect to it without a physical connection. It differs from a wireless router because it can interconnect a wired LAN with a WLAN, but not two separate networks such as the ISP's network and an internal private network. A WAP needs at least one antenna.

In the image above, the access point connects to the wired LAN, and the wireless devices that connect to the WAP are in the same subnet, meaning no NAT or PAT is being performed. It simply acts as a bridge between wireless devices and the rest of the network.
