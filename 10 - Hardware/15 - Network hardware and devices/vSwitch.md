Normally a virtual server has all of the virtualized servers running on the same IP subnet which can have QoS and security implications.

Fortunately, some servers give you layer 2 control such as VLAN separation and filtering. This is made possible by the virtual server not only virtualizing the instances of the servers but also by virtualizing a layer 2 switch.

Configuring a virtual switch today is relatively easy with powerful virtualization software such as Hyper-V.
