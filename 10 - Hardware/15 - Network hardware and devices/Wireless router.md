A wireless router is a form of [[router|router]] that allows devices to connect to it without any physical connection. They are generally slower than wired routers but give more convenience. Unlike a WAP, they can connect two networks. They need at least one antenna to work.

In the image above, the cable modem obtains an IP address using DHCP from the ISP. In turn, the router behind it also uses DHCP to prive IP addresses to LAN devices attached to it, either wired or wirelessly. The router uses PAT to allow packets to leave the LAN and go to the internet.

# Association
The process through which a wireless client, such as a laptop or smartphone, attaches to a wireless router or wireless access point is called association. All of the devices attached to that router/AP share a collision domain. Therefore, for scalability and performance reasons, WLANs might include multiple routers/APs.
