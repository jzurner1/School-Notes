Cisco Catalyst switches are Cisco's brand of LAN switches. Within this brand, there are a number of switch series/families, where each series includies several specific models of switches that have similar features, prices, performance, and internal components.

# Port naming scheme
Each port has both an interface type and interface number.

The interface type can be Ethernet (10Mbps), Fast Ethernet (100Mbps), Gigabit Ethernet (1000Mbps), and so on for faster speeds. For interfaces that support multiple speeds, the name of the fastest supported speed is used.

The interface number is two digits (x/y) on older devices and three digits (x/y/z) on newer devices. For example, two 1000 ports on an old switch may be called GigabitEthernet 0/0 and GigabitEthernet 0/1 while two 1000 ports on a new switch may be called GigabitEthernet 1/0/1 and GigabitEthernet 1/0/2.
