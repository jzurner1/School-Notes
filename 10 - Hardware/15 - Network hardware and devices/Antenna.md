The coverage area of a [[WLAN|WLAN]] is largely determined by the type of antenna [[hardware|hardware]] used on a WAP or wireless router. Although some lower-end WAPs have fixed antennas, higher-end WAPs often support various antenna types.

There are a few goals to keep in mind when selecting an antenna:
- Required distance between an AP and a wireless client
- Coverage area pattern, such as spherical versus one or two directions
- Indoor vs. outdoor environment
- Avoiding interference with other APs

### Omnidirectional
An omnidirectional antenna, sometimes called an omni, radiates power at equal levels in all directions.

### Unidirectional
A unidirectional antenna can focus its power in a specific direction, possibly avoiding interference with other wireless devices and possibly reaching a farther distance. If two WAPs want to communicate, it helps significantly if they have matching antenna orientations/polarities.
