Solid-state drives (SSDs) are used for long term [[storage|storage]] and are an alternative to hard drives. Instead of spinning disks, however, SSDs use flash memory that incorporate EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read only memory) chips, which is much faster.

SSDs are more expensive than hard disks, but they are lighter and much faster. This makes them ideal for more portable technologies such as laptops.
