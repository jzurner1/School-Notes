Memory is temporary [[storage|storage]] used to keep information for immediate use. There are two major types, RAM and ROM. It sits on the [[Motherboard|motherboard]].

# RAM
Random access memory, the working memory of a computer. When a computer boots, it begins to load information onto the RAM, which can transfer data much faster than the hard disk. All programs used on a computer must be loaded onto the RAM, so computers need a minimum amount of RAM to work effectively. RAM is volatile, so it can only store data while it is receiving power.

RAM is generally installed through a rouble data rate (DDR) memory module. The type of DDR accepted into a computer is dependent on the motherboard. There are four generations of DDR: DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, and DDR4. Each generation runs faster than the previous but consumes more voltage.

There are two major types of RAM, DRAM and SRAM

### DRAM
Dynamic RAM is less expensive but slower than SRAM. The 1s and 0s inside must be refreshed periodically while other processing occurs. Most memory on a motherboard is DRAM.

### SRAM
A small amount of SRAM can be found inside the processor, inside the processor housing, and sometimes on the motherboard. It is also known as cache memory. It holds the most frequently used data so the CPU does not return to the slower DRAM chips.

# ROM
Unlike RAM, ROM cannot be changed when it is set. It is often used for things such as remotes or smart watches that need quick memory that won't change.
