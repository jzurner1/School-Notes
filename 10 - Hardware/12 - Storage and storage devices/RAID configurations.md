Different [[RAID|RAID]] configurations provide different benefits.

# RAID 0
RAID 0 provides the fastest read/write speeds and maximum availability of storage, but there is no data redundancy. It does this by splitting data into smaller groups and storing it on separate disks.

For example, in a two-disk array, the data is split evenly across the two disks, doubling the speed. In a four-disk array, you can quadruple the speed, and so on.

# RAID 1
RAID 1 stores data on one disk and keeps a separate copy of that data on each of the remaining disks. It is best when data protection and redundancy are the primary goal.

# RAID 5
RAID 5 requires three or more drives and balances redundancy and performance. It does this by splitting data into groups across all of the available drives and creating distributed parity. If any drive fails, the data - or parity - on the other drives can reconstitute what was lost on the failed drive.

# RAID 10
RAID 10 nests at least two RAID 1 sets within a RAID 0 configuration. This blends performance with potentially higher fault tolerance. You can retain your data if you lose up to half of your disks, as long as the mirrored copy doesn't fail.

RAID 10 is often used in businesses where uptime and availability are critical for intense workflows.
