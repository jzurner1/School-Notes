A hard drive interface is a set of rules needed to make a [[hard drive|hard drive]] operate. The two major types are IDE/ATA/EIDE and SCSI. IDE is most common with home and office computers while SCSI is most common in storage networks or network servers.

# Parallel architecture
Both IDE and SCSI started out as parallel architectures, in which bits are sent over multiple paths. This required more precise timing as transfer rates increased. Multiple devices can attach to the same bus.

With parallel IDE/ATA (PATA) only two devices are supported but parallel SCSI supports more. The concept is the same with both of them.

# Serial architecture
Today, serial architecture is more common. This is a point-to-point bus in which each ddevice has just a single connection and bits are sent one at a time.

Both IDE/ATA and SCSI standards have serial architectures available. They are known as serial ATA (SATA) and serial attached SCSI (SAS). SATA drives are used for laptops and PCs while both are used for NAS drives
